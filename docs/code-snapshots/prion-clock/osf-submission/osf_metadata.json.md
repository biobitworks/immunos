  "description": "This project presents a theoretical hypothesis proposing that aging is driven by maternally-inherited cytoplasmic factors—proteins or protein aggregates transmitted via the egg cell—that accumulate throughout life as protein clearance systems decline. The model explains several puzzling observations: the 95-99% failure rate of cloning despite perfect genetic information, the ~60% loss of chromosomally normal embryos, proteome waves at predictable ages (34, 60, 78), and why 70% of supercentenarians die from the same protein misfolding disease. Recent evidence showing that maternal UBE2V1-induced protein aggregation directly impairs embryo development (Li et al. 2025) provides causal support for the framework. The hypothesis generates nine testable predictions using current technology. This project was developed through AI-assisted research collaboration using Claude (Anthropic), including systematic citation verification via IMMUNOS. All 53 citations independently verified.",
  "abstract": "Background: Maximum human lifespan is constrained to approximately 120-150 years, with ~70% of supercentenarians dying from transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), a protein misfolding disease. Recent evidence demonstrates that maternal protein aggregation state directly affects offspring development: elevated UBE2V1 in aging oocytes causes protein aggregation that is transmitted to embryos and impairs their viability. This finding suggests that cytoplasmic factors—not just genetic information—may be inherited across generations. Hypothesis: We propose that aging is driven by maternally-inherited cytoplasmic factors (proteins, protein aggregates, or other molecules) transmitted via the egg cell. These factors accumulate slowly throughout life as protein clearance mechanisms decline with age. This accumulation produces observed proteome waves at ages ~34, ~60, and ~78, and ultimately determines the maximum lifespan limit. Evidence: The hypothesis is supported by: (1) direct demonstration that maternal UBE2V1-mediated protein aggregation affects embryo development; (2) extremely low cloning efficiency (1-5%) despite perfect genetic information; (3) 60% failure rate of chromosomally-normal embryos; (4) proteome waves coinciding with clearance system decline; (5) universal protein misfolding endpoint (ATTR) in supercentenarians. Testable Predictions: The hypothesis generates nine specific predictions using current technology. Implications: If validated, this framework fundamentally alters longevity intervention strategies, shifting focus to pre-conception clearance of maternal cytoplasmic factors, prophylactic autophagy enhancement, and understanding cytoplasmic reset mechanisms.",
