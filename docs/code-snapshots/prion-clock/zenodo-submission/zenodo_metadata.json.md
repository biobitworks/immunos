  "title": "The Cytoplasmic Inheritance Timer Hypothesis: Maternally-Inherited Factors in Aging",
  "upload_type": "publication",

  "publication_date": "2025-12-19",
  "description": "This paper presents a theoretical hypothesis proposing that aging is driven by maternally-inherited cytoplasmic factors—proteins or protein aggregates transmitted via the egg cell—that accumulate throughout life as protein clearance systems decline. The model explains several puzzling observations: the 95-99% failure rate of cloning despite perfect genetic information, the ~60% loss of chromosomally normal embryos, proteome waves at predictable ages (34, 60, 78), and why 70% of supercentenarians die from the same protein misfolding disease. Recent evidence showing that maternal UBE2V1-induced protein aggregation directly impairs embryo development (Li et al. 2025) provides causal support for the framework. The hypothesis generates nine testable predictions using current technology. This project was developed through AI-assisted research collaboration using Claude (Anthropic), including systematic citation verification via IMMUNOS. All 53 citations independently verified.",
