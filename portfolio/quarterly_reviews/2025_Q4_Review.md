## Project Progress

### 1. GoFundMe Emergency Campaign

**Goal:** Raise $2,500 by October 9 to secure housing

**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Launch pending

**Progress:**
- ✅ All campaign materials complete (17 markdown files)
- ✅ Benefits impact verified (SSDI, CalFresh safe)
- ✅ Video script ready (90 seconds)
- ✅ Messaging templates created (4 audience tiers)
- ⏳ Photo conversion (HEIC → JPG)
- ⏳ Video filming (today, Oct 2)
- ⏳ Campaign launch (tomorrow, Oct 3)

**Success Metrics:**
- Day 1 (Oct 3): $300-500 raised
- Day 3 (Oct 5): $800-1,000 raised
- Day 7 (Oct 9): $2,000-2,500 raised ✅

**Risks:**
- Network size unknown (need to count LinkedIn/Telegram/Viva contacts)
- Video quality (phone camera, DIY setup)
- Donor fatigue (people may have seen too many campaigns)

**Mitigation:**
- Personal DMs to top 20 contacts (higher conversion than public posts)
- Birthday leverage (Oct 4 - emotional appeal)
- Multiple donation channels (GoFundMe + PayPal + Cash App)

---

### 2. HealthClock Platform

**Goal:** Complete beta version, onboard 3-5 test providers

**Status:** 🟡 HIGH - Development in progress

**Progress:**
- ✅ Billing assistant built (21KB component)
- ✅ AI integration complete (Anthropic Claude)
- ✅ Claims analytics dashboard created
- ✅ Healthcare codes database (71+ codes)
- ✅ Subscription tiers defined ($99/$249/$599)
- ⏳ Stripe integration (in progress)
- ⏳ Admin panel (in progress)
- ⏳ Beta user recruitment (pending)

**Q4 Milestones:**
- [ ] Week 2 (Oct 10-16): Complete Stripe integration
- [ ] Week 3 (Oct 17-23): Complete admin panel
- [ ] Week 4 (Oct 24-31): Deploy to staging, test end-to-end
- [ ] November: Recruit 3-5 beta providers (Viva/Vitalist networks)
- [ ] December: Beta testing, feedback collection, iteration

**Financial Plan:**
- No revenue in Q4 (beta is free trial)
- Target: 3-5 beta users by Dec 31
- Public launch: Q1 2026

**Risks:**
- Time crunch (GoFundMe crisis consuming October)
- No dedicated developer (solo founder)
- Beta user recruitment (cold outreach, low conversion)

**Mitigation:**
- Focus 100% on GoFundMe Oct 2-9, then shift to HealthClock
- Hire part-time developer if Fast Grant approved ($10K budget)
- Leverage existing networks (Viva, Vitalist, TruDiagnostic contacts)

---

### 3. BioViz Tech Grant Applications

**Goal:** Submit Foresight Fast Grant + Yunes Foundation proposal

**Status:** 🟢 MEDIUM - Applications complete

**Progress:**
- ✅ Foresight Fast Grant application (26K words, complete)
- ✅ Yunes Foundation proposal (47KB, complete)
- ✅ Convergent Research FRO proposal (10K+ words, complete)
- ⏳ Foresight submission (pending Oct 10+)
- ⏳ Yunes submission (pending Nov)

**Q4 Milestones:**
- [ ] Oct 10-15: Submit Foresight Fast Grant ($10K, 6 months)
- [ ] Nov 1-15: Submit Yunes Foundation proposal ($80K, 12-18 months)
- [ ] Dec: Foresight decision (if approved, start planning execution)

**Financial Impact:**
- Foresight approval: $10K in Q4 2025 (Dec payout)
- Yunes approval: $80K over 12-18 months (start Q1 2026)
- FRO approval: $10M over 3-5 years (submit Q4 2026, decision Q2 2027)

**Risks:**
- Competitive grants (many applicants, low acceptance rate)
- No track record (first major grant applications)
- Timing conflict (housing crisis delays submissions)

**Mitigation:**
- Applications already written (high quality, ready to submit)
- Leverage Board Secretary role at Yunes Foundation (insider advantage)
- Submit early (deadlines are rolling, first-mover advantage)

## Key Wins & Learnings

### October Wins (Projected)
- ✅ Complete portfolio strategy created (3 projects integrated)
- ✅ Financial analysis shows $18M ARR potential (HealthClock)
- ✅ Grant pipeline established ($10K → $80K → $10M)
- ✅ Benefits safety confirmed (GoFundMe won't jeopardize SSDI)

### Failures & Lessons (To Avoid)
- ⚠️ Housing crisis could have been prevented (better cash flow planning)
- ⚠️ Medical emergency depleted savings (need 3-month emergency fund)
- ⚠️ No revenue diversification until now (too dependent on SSDI)

### Key Insights
1. **Portfolio diversification works**: GoFundMe (survival) → HealthClock (revenue) → BioViz (impact)
2. **Benefits are safe**: Verified SSDI/CalFresh/Medicare unaffected by donations/grants/equity
3. **Competitive positioning strong**: HealthClock undercuts Kareo by 50%, unique longevity focus
4. **Grant pipeline realistic**: $10K → $80K → $10M progression makes sense

## Strategic Adjustments

### Original Plan vs. Adjusted Plan

**Original (September 2025):**
- Focus 100% on BioViz Tech grant applications
- HealthClock on hold until grants secure
- GoFundMe not anticipated (crisis emerged)

**Adjusted (October 2025):**
- **Priority 1:** GoFundMe (Oct 2-9) - Immediate survival
- **Priority 2:** HealthClock (Oct 10+) - Medium-term revenue
- **Priority 3:** BioViz grants (Oct 10-Nov) - Long-term impact

**Why the shift?**
- Housing crisis forced immediate action (GoFundMe)
- HealthClock financial analysis shows faster revenue path than grants
- Portfolio approach de-risks (don't depend on single grant approval)

### Key Decisions Made in Q4

**Decision 1: Keep billing assistant integrated (not standalone)**
- Rationale: Network effects, higher LTV, competitive moat
- Add white-label API for external clinics (dual revenue streams)

**Decision 2: Delay Yunes submission until November**
- Rationale: Housing crisis must resolve first (optics + focus)
- Better application quality with extra month of preparation

**Decision 3: Bootstrap HealthClock until traction**
- Rationale: Raise Seed after 10-20 customers (higher valuation)
- Use GoFundMe + SSDI + contract work for Q4-Q1 cash flow
