## Project Locations (DO NOT MOVE)

**Active Projects:**
- **HealthClock:** `/Users/byron/health-clock/` (Next.js app)
- **BioViz Tech:** `/Users/byron/bioviztech/` (Obsidian research vault)
- **GoFundMe Campaign:** `/Users/byron/gofundme-campaign-2025/` (Obsidian campaign vault)

**Why separate?**
- Each has different tech stack (Next.js vs Obsidian)
- Each has own git repository
- Each has tool-specific configurations
- Moving breaks dependencies and paths
