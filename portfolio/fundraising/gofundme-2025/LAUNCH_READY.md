## 🎯 YOUR NEXT STEPS (In Order)

### TODAY (Oct 2) - Remaining Hours:

#### 1. Convert Photo to JPG (5 minutes)
```bash
cd ~/gofundme-campaign-2025
sips -s format jpeg assets/photos/IMG_3744.heic --out assets/photos/IMG_3744.jpg
```

Then review: Does this photo work for campaign? (Face visible, good lighting?)

---

#### 2. Film Video (30-45 minutes)

**Setup:**
- Find well-lit, quiet room
- Phone camera is fine (portrait or landscape)
- Face fills most of frame, eye level

**Script:** `01_Campaign/Video_Script.md` (memorize key points, don't read)

**Key moments (85-90 seconds):**
- **0-10 sec:** "I'm Byron. I need $2,500 by October 9—that's 7 days—or I lose my housing."
- **10-35 sec:** Viva/Vitalist work + July hospitalization + current crisis
- **35-60 sec:** What's at stake (HealthClock, bioviz.tech, community work)
- **60-85 sec:** The ask ("Can you donate $10, $25, $50? Or share?") + gratitude

**Film 2-3 takes.** Choose the most authentic one (not necessarily most polished).

---

#### 3. Create Contact Lists (30 minutes)

**Make a simple spreadsheet or note:**

**Tier 1 - Close Friends (10-15 people):**
- [Name] | [How you know them] | [Contact method] | [Donation estimate]
- [Name] | [How you know them] | [Contact method] | [Donation estimate]

**Tier 2 - Viva Frontier Tower (15-20 people):**
- [Name] | [Cooked for them / organized events] | [Telegram / phone] | [$25-50]

**Tier 3 - Vitalist Bay (10-15 people):**
- [Name] | [Met at popup] | [Telegram / LinkedIn] | [$25-50]

**Track:** Who you message, when, if they responded, if they donated

---

## 📋 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### ✅ Your Benefits Are SAFE
- SSDI: $1,199/month = UNAFFECTED by GoFundMe
- CalFresh income: $1,449/month (SSDI + contract) = $1,061 UNDER $2,510 limit
- GoFundMe one-time gifts = NOT counted as income
- **You can do this without risk!**

### ✅ Your Campaign Facts (Accurate)
- **Deadline:** October 9 (Jerry's hard deadline)
- **Amount owed:** $1,326 deposit (you already paid $250 in Sept)
- **Additional expenses:** $315 Cash App (Oct 17) + $700 computer (Oct 9) + $159 medical
- **Total goal:** $2,500 (covers everything + fees)
- **Viva role:** VOLUNTEER Operations Manager (not paid)
- **Medical:** July hospitalization (cellulitis, 7 days) + ongoing recovery costs

### ✅ What Makes Your Campaign Strong

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

### Minimum Success:
- **$1,641** = Covers Jerry deposit + Cash App (delays computer)
- Negotiate payment plan with Jerry for balance
- Apply for emergency assistance to fill gap

### Target Success:
- **$2,000-2,500** = Covers all critical expenses
- Stay housed, continue work, medical expenses covered
- **This is realistic with your network!**

### Exceptional Success:
- **$2,500+** = Full coverage + small buffer
- Can focus entirely on HealthClock/bioviz.tech without financial stress
- Plan first longevity meetup at 1900 Broadway

---

## 📊 YOUR NETWORK ASSESSMENT

**Based on what you've told me:**
- Viva Frontier Tower: 15-20 strong connections
- Vitalist Bay: 10-15 connections
- LinkedIn: (you didn't provide number, but assume 100-200?)
- Telegram longevity groups: Access to 50-100+ people

**Realistic 7-day projection:**
- **60-100 donors** at $25-30 average = **$1,500-3,000**
- **You CAN hit $2,500** with strong outreach execution

**What matters most:**
- Personal DMs outperform public posts (3-5x conversion)
- First 48 hours set momentum
- Birthday leverage (Oct 4)
- Video dramatically increases donations (4x more than no video)

---

## ⚠️ POTENTIAL OBSTACLES & SOLUTIONS

### Obstacle: "I don't want to seem desperate"

**Solution:** You're not begging—you're inviting people to invest in work that serves the community. Medical emergencies happen. It's not your fault. Vulnerability builds connection.

---

### Obstacle: "People might judge me"

**Solution:** The people who judge aren't your people. Your real community will show up. Focus on the 80% who want to help, not the 20% who might criticize.

---

### Obstacle: "What if I don't hit the goal?"

**Solution:** Even $1,500 is HUGE. You can:
- Negotiate payment plan with Jerry ($800 now, $526 later)
- Apply for emergency assistance (Alameda ERAP)
- Delay computer purchase (use library computers temporarily)
- Pick up immediate gig work (DoorDash, sell items)

**You have backup plans.** Don't let fear of falling short prevent you from trying.

---

### Obstacle: "I hate asking for money"

**Solution:** You're not asking "for money"—you're asking for help staying housed so you can continue work that benefits others. HealthClock, bioviz.tech, community organizing = you give more than you take.

Frame it as: "Help me keep contributing" not "Give me money."

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### 1. Momentum is Everything
- First 48 hours determine campaign trajectory
- Early donors inspire later donors (social proof)
- Post your first donation screenshot (even if it's $10)
- "We're at $400 from 12 donors!" = encourages others to join

### 2. Thank Obsessively
- Thank every donor within 24 hours (personal message)
- Thank every share publicly
- Gratitude builds momentum and encourages more donations

### 3. Update Frequently
- Every 2-3 days minimum
- Show progress: "$1,200 raised! 48% to goal!"
- Create urgency: "72 hours left, need $800 more"
- Celebrate milestones: "We hit 50%! Thank you!"

### 4. Make it Easy
- Always include clickable link
- Mobile-friendly (most people donate on phones)
- Clear ask: "Can you donate $25?" (not "whatever you can")
- Offer share option: "Can't donate? Share helps just as much!"

### 5. Personal Beats Generic
- "Hey Sarah, you came to those dinners I cooked at Viva..." beats "Hi everyone"
- Mention specific memories
- Acknowledge relationship history
- People donate to people they know, not causes
