### Template 1A: Very Close Friend/Family

```
Hey [Name],

I'm reaching out because I'm in a genuinely tough spot and need to ask for help.

I have until October 9 to raise $1,326 for a housing deposit or I risk losing my apartment in Oakland. A medical emergency in July (7 days hospitalized with cellulitis) wiped out my savings, and now I'm facing this deadline while still catching up.

I'm running a GoFundMe to cover the deposit + some other critical expenses (credit card payment, computer replacement for work). Goal is $2,500 total.

I know you've [specific: supported me before / always been there / know how hard this year has been]. Would you be able to donate $25-50, or share the campaign with your network?

Link: [your GoFundMe URL]

I hate asking for money, but this is a real crisis. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for even reading this, [Name]. It means a lot.

Byron
```

**When to modify:**
- If they know about your medical situation already: "You know about my July hospitalization..."
- If they're in longevity community: "You know the work I'm doing with HealthClock and bioviz.tech..."
- If they've helped you before: "I know I've asked for help before, but..."

### Template 1B: Close Friend (Slightly Less Formal)

```
[Name] - quick ask

I've got a housing crisis situation and need to ask for help. Made a GoFundMe, need $2,500 by Oct 9 or I lose my place in Oakland.

Long story short: July hospitalization emptied savings → now facing $1,326 deposit deadline + other expenses

Could you donate $20-30 or share with anyone who might help?

[your GoFundMe URL]

Full details in the campaign, but figured I'd reach out directly since you've always had my back.

Thanks man/girl/friend 🙏

**Expected donation:** $25-50
**Expected response rate:** 40-60%

### Template 2A: People You Cooked For

```
Hey [Name],

Byron here from Viva Frontier Tower! Hope you're doing well.

I'm reaching out because I'm in a tough spot. You might remember I was hospitalized in July with cellulitis (while I was still at Viva). That medical situation depleted my savings, and now I'm facing a housing crisis in Oakland—need $1,326 by Oct 9 for a security deposit or I lose my place.

I started a GoFundMe to cover the deposit + a few other critical expenses: [your GoFundMe URL]

I know you came to [specific: those dinners I cooked / the popup events / community gatherings] and hopefully saw the work I put into building that community. I'm asking if you could donate $15-25, or share the campaign with anyone who might be able to help.

Goal is $2,500 total by Oct 9. Even $10 makes a real difference.

Thanks for even considering this, [Name]. The Viva community meant a lot to me, and I'm grateful we connected.

### Template 2B: Viva Leadership/Organizers

```
[Name],

I'm reaching out with a vulnerable ask. I'm facing a housing emergency and wondered if you could help by donating or sharing my GoFundMe campaign.

Quick context: The July cellulitis hospitalization (you might remember I was out for a couple weeks) wiped out my savings. Now I'm facing a $1,326 deposit deadline by October 9 for my Oakland apartment, plus other critical expenses.

Campaign: [your GoFundMe URL]
Goal: $2,500 by Oct 9

I put a lot of heart into the Operations Manager work at Viva—those community dinners, the organizing, the late nights making sure things ran smoothly. Now I need the community to have my back for a moment.

Could you:
1. Donate $25-50 if you're able, OR
2. Share this in any Viva groups/channels I'm not in, OR
3. Forward to anyone in your network who might help

I know you're connected to people who care about community builders going through hard times. Even a share would mean the world.

Thanks for everything you did to build Viva, [Name]. That experience changed my trajectory.

Gratefully,
Byron

**Expected donation:** $25-50
**Expected response rate:** 30-50%
**Timing:** Day 3-4 (Oct 4-5)

### Template 3: Vitalist Bay Network

```
[Name],

Byron Lee here—we connected at Vitalist Bay earlier this year (the longevity popup in [April/May]).

I'm reaching out because I'm facing a housing crisis and need help from the longevity community. Medical emergency in July (7-day hospitalization) depleted my savings, and now I have until October 9 to raise $1,326 for a housing deposit or I lose my place in Oakland.

I'm running a GoFundMe ($2,500 goal) to cover the deposit + other critical expenses: [your GoFundMe URL]

Why I'm asking the longevity community specifically: I'm actively working on two projects—**HealthClock** (health tracking app) and **bioviz.tech** (FRO imaging for aging research, applying for Foresight/FRO grants). Staying housed means I can keep contributing to the longevity mission we all share.

Could you donate $20-30, or share with your network? Even a share helps tremendously.

I know you're connected to people who understand the importance of supporting researchers during tough times. This is one of those moments.

Thank you for considering, [Name]. Hope to see you at future longevity events!

**Who:** Professional connections, Georgia State alumni, bioinformatics colleagues
**Expected donation:** $15-30
**Expected response rate:** 10-20%
**Timing:** Day 3 (Oct 4) - PUBLIC POST

### LinkedIn Public Post:

```
I'm reaching out to my professional network during a vulnerable moment.

Due to a medical emergency this summer (7-day hospitalization with cellulitis) followed by an unexpected housing deposit increase, I'm facing a housing crisis in Oakland. I need to raise $2,500 by October 9 to avoid losing my home.

Over the past year, I've been building longevity community infrastructure in the Bay Area—volunteering at Viva Frontier Tower, participating in Vitalist Bay, and developing two research projects:

• HealthClock: Personal health tracking app for longevity optimization
• bioviz.tech: FRO imaging technology for aging research (currently applying for Foresight Fast Grant and Convergent Research FRO funding)

I'm asking for support to stay housed so I can continue this work.

GoFundMe: [your link]

If you've appreciated my contributions to the longevity/biotech community, or simply believe in supporting community builders during crisis, any donation ($10, $25, $50+) or share helps.

I'll provide transparent updates every 2-3 days on how funds are used.

Thank you for considering this.

**Who:** Older family, professors, mentors, people not on social media

**Expected response rate:** 20-40%
**Timing:** Day 2-3 (Oct 3-4)

### Email Template:

**Subject:** Asking for Help – Housing Crisis by October 9

```
Dear [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out during a difficult moment to ask for your help.

I'm facing a housing crisis in Oakland, California, where I've been building longevity research projects and community infrastructure over the past year. Due to a medical emergency this summer—I was hospitalized for 7 days with severe cellulitis (bacterial infection)—my savings were depleted. Now I'm facing a $1,326 security deposit deadline by October 9, and I don't have the funds to cover it.

I've started a GoFundMe campaign to raise $2,500, which will cover:
• $1,326 housing deposit (due October 9 to my roommate Jerome)
• $315 credit card payment (due October 17, unavoidable)
• $700 computer replacement (mine must be returned Oct 9, needed for work)
• $159 medical expenses for October (ongoing wound care, travel to doctors)

GoFundMe link: [your URL]

I know you've [supported me during grad school / been a mentor / always encouraged my research / etc.], and I wondered if you'd be willing to donate $25-50, or share this campaign with anyone in your network who might be able to help.

The work I'm doing—HealthClock (personal health tracking app) and bioviz.tech (imaging technology for aging research)—is meaningful to me, and staying housed means I can continue contributing to the longevity field we both care about.

I'll provide transparent updates on how the funds are used, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.

Thank you for even considering this, [Name]. Your support over the years has meant more than you know.

With gratitude,
Byron Lee

P.S. My birthday is October 4, right in the middle of this campaign. The best gift would be knowing I have stable housing to continue this work.

```
[Name]—

I just saw your $[amount] donation to my GoFundMe. I'm honestly tearing up right now.

Byron

### Thank You for Shares:

Hey [Name],

Really appreciate you having my back during this crisis. It means more than you know.

Gratefully,
Byron
```

## 📝 MESSAGING BEST PRACTICES

### DO:
- ✅ Personalize first line (use their name, reference how you know them)
- ✅ Be specific about dollar amounts ($20-30, not "whatever you can")
- ✅ Give them an "out" (share option if they can't donate)
- ✅ Mention deadline (October 9 urgency)
- ✅ Keep it under 200 words (people skim)
- ✅ Make it easy (include link, don't make them search)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Copy/paste identical message to everyone (people can tell)
- ❌ Apologize excessively ("Sorry to bother you...")
- ❌ Guilt trip ("I helped you when...")
- ❌ Send multiple messages to same person in same day
- ❌ Message people at odd hours (respect time zones)
- ❌ Get defensive if they don't respond (assume best intentions)

---

## ⏰ OPTIMAL TIMING

**Best times to send messages (PDT):**
- **DMs/Texts:** 10 AM - 8 PM (avoid early morning/late night)
- **LinkedIn:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM (professionals check before meetings)
- **Telegram:** 6-9 PM (after work hours)
- **Email:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9 AM - 12 PM (checked during work hours)

**Avoid:**
- Monday mornings (people catching up)
- Friday evenings (weekend mode)
- Late nights (11 PM+, looks desperate)

---

## 📞 IF SOMEONE ASKS QUESTIONS

### "Why don't you apply for emergency assistance?"

```
Great question—I am! I've applied to Alameda County ERAP and contacted 211 Bay Area. Those programs take 7-10 days for decisions, and my deadline is October 9. The GoFundMe is to bridge that gap while emergency assistance is being processed.
```

---

### "Can't your roommate wait on the deposit?"

```
Unfortunately no—Jerome (my roommate) has to pay the landlord by October 15, so he needs my portion ($1,326) by October 9 to make that deadline. It's a hard deadline from the property management company (Bozzuto).
```

---

### "What about family?"

```
I wish that were an option. My family situation is complicated, and they're not in a position to help with this amount on this timeline. That's why I'm reaching out to the community I've built here in the Bay Area.
```

---

### "Will this affect your disability benefits?"

```
I've researched this thoroughly—GoFundMe personal gifts do NOT count as income for SSDI (which I receive). My benefits are completely safe. I've documented the benefits impact analysis if you want to see the details.
```
