Hey [Name],

I need to ask for help with something urgent. I'm facing a housing crisis—need $1,326 by Oct 9 for a security deposit or I risk losing my apartment in Oakland.

Long story: July hospitalization (cellulitis, 7 days) wiped out my savings. Now I'm short on the deposit deadline while still catching up on medical expenses.

I'm raising $2,500 total to cover:
• $1,326 deposit (due to roommate Oct 9)
• $315 credit card payment (Oct 17)
• $700 computer replacement (mine goes back Oct 9, need it for work)
• Medical expenses ongoing

Would you be able to help with $25-50?

You can donate via:
• GoFundMe: [link - add after launch]
• PayPal: byron@biobitworks.com
• Cash App: @biobitworks

I know you've [supported me before / always been there / know how hard this year has been]. Even $20 makes a real difference, or sharing with anyone who might help.

I hate asking but this is a real emergency. Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks for even reading this, [Name] 🙏

### Template 1B: Close Friend (More Casual, Text)

```
[Name] - need your help with something

Got a housing crisis. Need $1,326 by Oct 9 or lose my place in Oakland. July hospital stay emptied my savings, now facing this deadline.

Made a GoFundMe for $2,500 total (deposit + other expenses)

Payment options:
• GoFundMe: [link]
• PayPal: byron@biobitworks.com

### Template 1C: Family Member (Text/Call Script)

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out because I'm in a difficult situation and need help.

I was hospitalized in July with a serious infection (cellulitis - 7 days inpatient). That depleted my savings, and now I'm facing an October 9 deadline for a $1,326 housing deposit. Without it, I could lose my apartment in Oakland.

I've set up a GoFundMe to raise $2,500 to cover the deposit plus other critical expenses (credit card payment, computer for work, ongoing medical costs).

Would you be able to contribute $50? Or $25 if that's easier?

You can send directly if you prefer:
• PayPal: byron@biobitworks.com
• Cash App: @biobitworks
• Or GoFundMe: [link]

I know things have been tight for everyone, but I'm asking family first because this is a real emergency. Even $20 helps, or sharing the campaign with anyone who might be able to contribute.

Thank you for considering this, [Name]. It means a lot.

Love,
Byron

P.S. I'm also doing contract work and trying to earn money, but the deadline is too soon to make up the full amount on my own.
