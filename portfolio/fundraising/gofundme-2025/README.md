## Campaign Goals

### Option A: $2,400 (Recommended - More Achievable)
- $1,576 - Lease deposit due Oct 9
- $315 - Cash App payment due Oct 17
- $509 - Buffer for fees/unexpected costs

### Option B: $4,200 (Requires Stronger Network Response)
- All of Option A +
- $1,800 - November rent + essentials stabilization

## Critical Decision Points

**You need to answer these questions before launch:**

### 1. Housing Details
- [ ] What exactly is the $1,576 for?
- [ ] Current vs new housing situation?
- [ ] Landlord negotiation attempts/results?
- [ ] Can $315 Cash App payment be delayed?

### 2. Income Analysis
- [ ] Exact monthly SSDI amount?
- [ ] Contract work client(s) and why inconsistent?
- [ ] Any outstanding invoices owed to you?
- [ ] CalFresh/Medi-Cal enrollment status?

### 3. Emergency Resources Contacted
- [ ] Alameda County ERAP application status?
- [ ] Oakland Housing Authority consultation?
- [ ] 211 Bay Area emergency assistance?
- [ ] Catholic Charities East Bay?
- [ ] Bay Area Legal Aid (tenant rights)?

### 4. Student Loan Discharge Opportunity
- [ ] SSDI start date and duration?
- [ ] Loan servicer (MOHELA/Nelnet/etc.)?
- [ ] Aware of TPD Discharge program? (Could eliminate $130K)
- [ ] Current loan status (repayment/deferment/default)?

### 5. Community Network Leverage
- [ ] Have you directly asked Viva/Vitalist community for emergency help?
- [ ] Any 1900 Broadway network members with temporary housing options?
- [ ] Professional longevity contacts who could provide contract work THIS WEEK?

### 6. Campaign Strategy
- [ ] Social media following size (LinkedIn/Instagram/Twitter)?
- [ ] Choose $2,400 or $4,200 goal?
- [ ] Keep or remove "42" Hitchhiker's Guide theme?
- [ ] How many people can you reach in 7 days?

## Timeline

- **Oct 2 (Today):** Answer discovery questions → finalize strategy
- **Oct 2 PM:** Launch GoFundMe with video + photo
- **Oct 2-3:** DM 15-20 close contacts personally
- **Oct 4 (Birthday):** LinkedIn + Telegram group posts
- **Oct 5-6:** Mid-campaign momentum push
- **Oct 7-8:** Final 48-hour urgency messaging
- **Oct 9:** Deadline day - secure housing or activate Plan B

## Key Strategic Revisions from Original Draft

### ✅ Improvements Made
1. **Removed TOS-violating "repay" language** → Changed to "donor appreciation perks"
2. **Reframed past expenses** → Focus on contributions (organizing, cooking) not payments ($900/$2,000)
3. **Added hospitalization context** → July cellulitis crisis explains financial depletion
4. **Realistic goal setting** → $2,400 achievable vs $4,200 aspirational

### ⚠️ Still Under Review
1. **"42" theme appropriateness** → May undermine crisis urgency
2. **November rent inclusion** → Dilutes immediate emergency narrative
3. **Network size assessment** → Need actual reach numbers to set realistic goal

## Next Steps

1. **Byron answers discovery questions** (see financial-strategy/crisis-triage.md when created)
2. **Wealth architect delivers action plan** based on answers
3. **Finalize campaign copy** in campaign-drafts/final-version.md
4. **Create video script** and film 90-second pitch
5. **Prepare messaging templates** for each channel
6. **Launch and execute** day-by-day timeline
