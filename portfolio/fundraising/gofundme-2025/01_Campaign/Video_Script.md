# 90-Second Video Script

**Purpose:** Authentic, urgent video pitch for GoFundMe campaign
**Length:** 85-90 seconds (under 90 is ideal for viewer completion)
**Tone:** Direct, vulnerable, urgent but hopeful
**Setting:** Well-lit room, minimal background noise, face clearly visible

---

## 🎥 VIDEO SETUP TIPS

**Lighting:**
- Film near window (natural light) or in well-lit room
- Face should be evenly lit (no harsh shadows)
- Avoid backlighting (don't film with window behind you)

**Audio:**
- Quiet room (no traffic, roommates, HVAC noise)
- Speak clearly, moderate pace
- Phone mic is fine (no need for external mic)

**Framing:**
- Portrait (vertical) or landscape (horizontal) both work
- Your face fills most of frame (not too far away)
- Eye level or slightly above (not looking up at camera)
- Sit or stand - whatever feels natural

**Takes:**
- Film 2-3 takes
- First take is usually stiff - second/third better
- Don't aim for perfection - authenticity matters more
- If you mess up, just restart that section

## 📝 SCRIPT (Read naturally, not memorized)

**[0-10 seconds: HOOK + CRISIS]**

> "Hi, I'm Byron Lee. I have until **October 9—that's 7 days—to raise $2,500**, or I lose my housing in Oakland."
>
> *[Pause, make eye contact with camera]*
>
> "I'm reaching out because I know many of you have seen the work I do in the longevity community."

---

**[10-35 seconds: CONTEXT + WHAT HAPPENED]**

> "Over the past year, I've been organizing dinners at Viva Frontier Tower, participating in Vitalist Bay, and building longevity community in the Bay Area. I'm working on two research projects—**HealthClock**, a health tracking app, and **bioviz.tech**, an imaging technology for aging research."
>
> *[Slight pause]*
>
> "But in July, I was hospitalized for a week with cellulitis—a serious infection. That depleted my savings. Now my roommate needs **$1,326 by October 9** for an increased security deposit, and I'm short. I also need **$315 for a credit card payment** and **$700 to replace my computer**, which has to be returned the same day."

---

**[35-60 seconds: WHAT'S AT STAKE + WHY IT MATTERS]**

> "If I can raise this $2,500, I stay housed. I can keep working on HealthClock and the FRO imaging grant. I can keep building longevity community here in Oakland—my building has amazing event spaces perfect for meetups."
>
> *[More personal, vulnerable tone]*
>
> "If I don't hit this goal, I lose my housing. And honestly, that means I lose my ability to stay connected to this community and this work that I care about so deeply."

---

**[60-85 seconds: THE ASK + GRATITUDE]**

> "I'm asking for help. **Can you donate $10? $25? $50?** Every dollar gets me closer to that $2,500 by October 9."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "If you can't donate, can you **share this campaign** with someone in your network who cares about longevity, who cares about community, who might be able to help?"
>
> *[Final direct eye contact]*
>
> "This community has given me so much. Your support right now would mean I can keep giving back. The link is below. Thank you for even watching this."
>
> *[Small genuine smile]*
>
> "Let's keep building the future together."

**[END]**

*[Hold final frame for 2 seconds, then stop recording]*

## 🎬 ALTERNATE VERSIONS

### Shorter Version (60 seconds):

**If you need to cut 30 seconds, remove the middle section and tighten:**

> "Hi, I'm Byron. I need $2,500 by October 9 or I lose my housing in Oakland.
>
> Many of you know me from Viva Frontier Tower, Vitalist Bay, or through my longevity research work—I'm building HealthClock and bioviz.tech imaging technology.
>
> In July, I was hospitalized with a serious infection that wiped out my savings. Now I'm facing a $1,326 deposit deadline, a $315 credit card payment, and need a $700 computer replacement—all by October 9.
>
> If I hit this goal, I stay housed and keep working on projects that serve our community. If not, I lose my base to continue this work.
>
> Can you help? $10, $25, $50—anything helps. Or share this with your network. Link below. Thank you for watching. Let's keep building the future together."

---

### Longer Version (2 minutes):

**If you want to add emotional depth, expand the medical section:**

> *[After mentioning hospitalization]*
>
> "That was a really scary time. Seven days in the hospital, then weeks of recovery—traveling to San Francisco for wound care, weekly doctor visits. I was still trying to contribute to the community, still cooking meals, still showing up. But financially, it cleaned me out. And I'm still catching up."
>
> *[Then continue with regular script]*

## 📱 B-ROLL (Optional Bonus Footage)

If you want to create a more polished video with editing, film these extra clips:

**3-5 second clips of:**
- Your computer workspace (showing HealthClock or bioviz.tech work)
- 1900 Broadway building exterior
- Event space photos (boardroom, sky deck, lounge)
- You cooking/at community events (if you have photos)
- San Francisco doctor's office or BART (showing ongoing medical context)

**How to use:**
- Main audio: Your voice from talking-head video
- Visuals: Overlay B-roll during key moments
- Example: When you say "HealthClock app," show screenshot
- When you say "my building has event spaces," show photo of boardroom

**But honestly:** A simple talking-head video is fine. Authenticity > production value.

## 🎭 PERFORMANCE TIPS

### What Works on GoFundMe Videos:

**DO:**
- ✅ Make direct eye contact with camera (like talking to a friend)
- ✅ Show genuine emotion (it's okay to be vulnerable)
- ✅ Speak at conversational pace (not rushed)
- ✅ Mention specific dollar amounts and deadline
- ✅ Show your face clearly (no hats, sunglasses, dim lighting)
- ✅ Be yourself (authenticity builds trust)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Read from script on-screen (memorize key points instead)
- ❌ Over-rehearse (sounds robotic)
- ❌ Apologize excessively ("Sorry to ask for help...")
- ❌ Make it too long (lose viewers after 2 minutes)
- ❌ Use jargon (explain "FRO," "longevity," etc. simply)
- ❌ Forget the direct ask ("Can you donate $25?")

### Body Language:
- Sit up straight (shows confidence despite vulnerability)
- Use natural hand gestures (but not too much - keep hands in frame or still)
- Slight lean forward when making the ask (shows engagement)
- Genuine facial expressions (match emotion to words)

### Vocal Delivery:
- **Hook (0-10 sec):** Clear, direct, slightly urgent
- **Context (10-35 sec):** Storytelling pace, warm
- **Stakes (35-60 sec):** More emotional, vulnerable
- **Ask (60-85 sec):** Direct, hopeful, grateful
