## 📝 CAMPAIGN STORY (Copy this to GoFundMe)

Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out to the longevity community that has become my home over the past year. Many of you know me from **Viva Frontier Tower**, **Vitalist Bay**, or through my work in the Oakland longevity and biotech community.

**I'm facing a housing crisis and need your help by October 9.**

---

### What Happened:

My roommate Jerome needs **$1,326 from me by October 9** to cover an increased security deposit for our apartment at 1900 Broadway in Oakland. Without this payment, I risk losing my housing—and with it, my ability to continue the community work and research projects I've dedicated myself to.

This financial strain comes on the heels of a difficult summer. **In July, I was hospitalized for 7 days with severe cellulitis**, a serious bacterial infection that required intensive treatment. The hospitalization and ongoing recovery—including weekly doctor visits in San Francisco, wound care supplies, and BART travel costs—depleted my savings while I was still trying to rebuild after relocating from Florida to the Bay Area.

I'm now on my feet but stretched extremely thin, working on contract projects while managing ongoing medical expenses and the unexpected deposit increase.

---

### My Commitment to the Longevity Community:

Over the past year, I've poured myself into building connections and contributing to the longevity movement in the Bay Area:

- **At Viva Frontier Tower** (May-August 2025): I volunteered as Operations Manager, organizing community dinners, cooking meals for residents, and fostering the collaborative environment many of you experienced there. While I received housing in exchange for my work, I paid additional costs to support the community.

- **At Vitalist Bay** (April-May 2025): I participated in the longevity popup, connecting with researchers and builders working on life extension technologies.

- **Current Projects**: I'm developing two longevity-focused initiatives:
  - **HealthClock app** – A tool to transform personal health tracking for longevity optimization
  - **bioviz.tech FRO imaging** – Advanced imaging technology for aging research (applying for Foresight Fast Grant and Convergent Research FRO funding)

- **Community Building**: I'm organizing longevity and biotech meetups, and my apartment building (1900 Broadway) has incredible event spaces—Fortune 500-quality boardrooms, a penthouse lounge, and sky deck—perfect for hosting community gatherings once I'm stabilized.

This work has been meaningful but financially unsustainable, especially after the medical crisis in July. Now a single missed payment has put everything at risk.

---

### What I Need:

**Total: $2,500**

Here's exactly where your donations will go:

- **$1,326** – Increased security deposit payment to my roommate Jerome (due October 9)
- **$315** – Credit card payment due October 17 (unavoidable, prevents penalties/interest)
- **$700** – Computer replacement (my current laptop must be returned October 9, and I need it for contract work income)
- **$159** – Medical expenses for October (BART travel to SF doctors, wound care supplies: ~$20-50/week)

After GoFundMe's transaction fees (~$73), this will net **$2,427**, which fully covers these critical expenses.

---

### Why This Matters:

**Staying housed means:**
- Continuing **HealthClock** and **bioviz.tech** development
- Having a stable base to complete my grant applications (decisions expected in coming months)
- Maintaining the community connections we've built
- Using 1900 Broadway's premium event spaces to host longevity meetups and bring our community together
- Generating income through contract work (computer is essential for this)

**Beyond just housing:** This is about keeping someone engaged in longevity research and community building at a critical moment. The work I'm doing—both the technical projects and the community organizing—contributes to our shared goal of extending healthy human lifespan.

---

### Full Context:

I relocated from Orlando to the Bay Area because this is where the longevity movement is happening. My rent increased from $725/month in Florida to $1,300/month in Oakland—a 79% jump—but it was worth it to be part of this community.

I'm also managing long-term financial obligations (~$130,000 in federal student loans from my M.Sc. in Bioinformatics at Georgia State University, and other debts), but those aren't the immediate crisis. This **$2,500 keeps me housed NOW**, so I can focus on rebuilding stable income and continuing work that benefits our shared mission.

I receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and am actively working to increase my contract work income while staying within allowable limits. The July hospitalization set me back significantly, and I'm still catching up.

---

### How You Can Help:

**Every dollar counts.** If you can donate $10, $25, $50, or more—it all adds up and makes a real difference.

**Can't donate?** Sharing this campaign with your networks is equally valuable. I know many of you are connected to people who care about longevity, community resilience, and supporting fellow researchers during tough times.

---

### Donor Appreciation:

As a token of gratitude for your support, I'm offering:

- **$10+**: Heartfelt thank-you note + early updates on HealthClock app development
- **$25+**: Exclusive insights into bioviz.tech FRO imaging research + campaign shout-out
- **$50+**: Invitation to upcoming longevity meetup at 1900 Broadway (virtual or in-person option)
- **$100+**: Beta access to HealthClock app OR one-on-one longevity research discussion

---

### Transparency & Updates:

I'll provide updates every 2-3 days on campaign progress and exactly how funds are used:
- Payment to Jerome (with receipt)
- Credit card payment confirmation
- Computer purchase receipt
- Medical expense tracking

This community has given me so much—connections, inspiration, collaboration, and friendship. **Your support would allow me to keep giving back.**

Thank you for even considering helping during this vulnerable moment. Let's keep building the future of longevity together.

With deep gratitude,
**Byron Lee**
M.Sc. Bioinformatics, Georgia State University
HealthClock & bioviz.tech | Oakland, CA

*P.S. – My birthday is October 4, right in the middle of this campaign. The best gift would be knowing I have stable housing to continue this work. If you're a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fan, you might notice the goal is close to "42" × 100... because sometimes the answer really is in the question of how we support each other. 😊*

## 📊 CAMPAIGN UPDATES SCHEDULE

### Update 1 - Launch Day (Oct 2, Evening):
"🙏 Campaign launched! I need $2,500 by October 9 to keep my housing. Already at $[amount] thanks to [X] incredible early supporters. If you haven't had a chance to see the campaign yet: [link]

Thank you to everyone sharing and donating. Every bit helps as we count down to the Oct 9 deadline."

### Update 2 - Day 2-3 (Oct 3-4):
"📊 Progress Update: We're at $[amount] ([X]% of goal) with [X] generous donors. Still need $[remaining] by October 9.

Tomorrow is my birthday (Oct 4), and honestly, the best gift would be knowing I'm going to make this deadline. If you've been meaning to donate or share, now is the time!

Special thanks to [mention 2-3 donors by first name only, if they gave permission]. Your support means everything. 🙏"

### Update 3 - Mid-Campaign (Oct 5-6):
"⏰ Halfway there! We've raised $[amount] from [X] amazing supporters. That leaves $[remaining] needed in the next [X] days.

I'm blown away by this community's generosity. Every $10, $25, $50 donation is literally keeping me housed and able to continue working on HealthClock and bioviz.tech.

For those who can't donate: sharing this with just 3 people in your network could make all the difference. We're so close!"

### Update 4 - Final Push (Oct 7-8):
"🚨 URGENT: 48 hours left! We're at $[amount] – just $[remaining] short of the goal.

I'm reaching out one more time: if you've been on the fence about donating, this is the moment. Jerome needs the $1,326 deposit payment by October 9, and time is running out.

Even $10 helps. If 20 people donate $25, we hit the goal. We can do this! 🙏

[If close to goal]: We're SO CLOSE! Just $[remaining] away from making this happen. Please share with your networks one more time!"

### Update 5 - Success (After Oct 9):
"✅ WE DID IT! Thanks to [X] incredible donors, we raised $[amount]!

I made the deposit payment to Jerome today [include photo of receipt if appropriate]. My housing is secure, and I can now focus on:
- Completing HealthClock app beta
- Finalizing bioviz.tech grant applications
- Planning our first longevity meetup at 1900 Broadway (details coming soon!)

I cannot express how grateful I am. This community showed up in a huge way. I'll be sending personal thank-you notes to every donor over the next week.

For those who donated $50+, watch for your meetup invitation coming soon.

Thank you for believing in me and in the work we're building together. Let's change the world. 💙"

---

### Update 6 - Partial Success (If you fall short):
"💙 Thank you to [X] donors who raised $[amount]!

We didn't quite hit the full $2,500, but here's what I'm doing:

1. Paid Jerome $[amount available] toward the $1,326 deposit
2. Negotiated a payment plan: I'll pay the remaining $[amount] by [date]
3. Prioritizing: Computer purchase delayed, Cash App payment covered, medical expenses managed

The campaign stays open through [date] if anyone else wants to contribute to help me finish the payment plan.

Even if we don't reach the full goal, your support made an enormous difference. I'm not losing my housing, and that's because of you.

More updates to come as I work through this. Thank you for standing with me during this crisis. 🙏"
