# Claude's GoFundMe Revision - Strategic Improvements

**Recommended Goal:** $2,400 (or $4,200 with revised framing)

## Critical Strategic Changes

### 1. ✅ Add Hospitalization Context
**Why:** Community knows this happened; builds credibility and explains financial depletion

**Revised Language:**
> "I contributed to Viva Frontier Tower from June-September through community meal preparation, event organizing, and operations management support. In July, I was hospitalized for 7 days with severe cellulitis, requiring weeks of recovery with wound care and weekly doctor visits. This health crisis depleted my savings and set me back financially while I was still contributing to the community."

### 2. ✅ Reframe Past Expenses
**Problem:** "I paid $900/$2,000" makes donors think: "Why should I fund someone who had money for events?"

**Solution:** Focus on **contribution** (work, organizing, cooking) not payment amounts.

### 3. ✅ Remove/Minimize "42" Theme
**Problem:** May seem tone-deaf during housing crisis; makes campaign feel less urgent

**Recommendation:**
- Remove from title entirely
- Mention once casually at end if you must: "For any Hitchhiker's fans, the goal happens to be 42"
- Don't make it central to pitch

### 4. ✅ Fix "Repay" Language (TOS Violation)
**Critical:** "Repay you with exclusive access" suggests loan/quid-pro-quo, violates GoFundMe Terms

**Replace with:**
- "Thank donors with early access to…"
- "Donor perks include…"
- "As a token of appreciation, supporters receive…"

### 5. ✅ Goal Recommendation
**Option A (Recommended):** $2,400 - emergency deposit only
- More achievable in 7 days
- Clearer crisis narrative
- Realistic for network size

**Option B:** $4,200 - reframe November as "breathing room to stabilize after health crisis"
- Requires exceptional network response
- Needs stronger justification

## Revised Campaign Draft

### **New Title:**
"Help Me Stay Housed in Oakland – Continue Longevity Community Work"

**Why:** Clearer, more urgent, removes gimmicky "42" reference, emphasizes location and purpose.

---

## Campaign Story

**Hi everyone,**

I'm reaching out to the longevity community that's become my home over the past year. Many of you know me from **Viva Frontier Tower**, **Vitalist Bay**, or our **longevity meetups at 1900 Broadway in Oakland**.

### What Happened:

A contract job payment I was counting on ($50-100/hour monthly work) fell through unexpectedly, and now I'm facing a housing crisis. My landlord is requiring an additional **$1,576 lease deposit by October 9** to keep my room, and I simply don't have it. Without this, I risk losing my housing—and with it, my ability to continue the community work I've dedicated myself to.

### My Commitment to This Community:

Over the past year, I've poured myself into building the longevity community in the Bay Area:

- **At Viva Frontier Tower** (June-September): I organized community dinners, cooked meals for the popup and longevity floor residents, and helped foster the collaborative environment many of you experienced there

- **Health Crisis Impact**: In July, I was hospitalized for 7 days with severe cellulitis, requiring weeks of recovery with wound care and weekly doctor visits. This health crisis depleted my savings and set me back financially while I was still contributing to the community.

- **At Vitalist Bay** (April-May): I participated in the longevity popup, connecting with researchers and builders working on life extension

- **Currently**: I'm organizing longevity biotech meetups at 1900 Broadway and developing two projects:
  - **HealthClock app** – A tool to transform personal health tracking
  - **bioviz.tech FRO imaging** – Longevity-focused imaging technology

This work has been meaningful but financially unsustainable. I've been living lean to stay engaged in this community, and now a single missed payment has put everything at risk.

### What I Need:

**Total: $2,400**

- **$1,576** – Lease deposit due October 9 to secure my housing
- **$315** – Cash App payment due October 17 (avoiding penalties that compound the problem)
- **$509** – Buffer for GoFundMe fees and unexpected costs

*[Alternative if keeping $4,200: Add "**$1,800** – November rent ($1,300) and essentials ($500) to give me breathing room to stabilize contract income without the constant threat of eviction"]*

### Full Context:

I'm also managing significant long-term debts (~$130K in federal student loans, $5,200 to UCF, $3,500 in credit cards), but those aren't the immediate crisis. This $2,400 keeps me housed **now**, so I can focus on rebuilding stable income through contract work and continuing the projects that benefit our community.

### What Your Support Enables:

Keeping me housed means:
- Continuing **HealthClock app** development
- Advancing **bioviz.tech FRO imaging** research
- Hosting **longevity meetups at 1900 Broadway** (Oakland has world-class venue space for our community)
- Maintaining the community connections we've built

### Donor Appreciation:

As a thank you for your support:

- **$10+**: Early HealthClock app updates and personal thank-you note
- **$25+**: Exclusive bioviz.tech insights and campaign shout-out
- **$50+**: Invitation to next longevity meetup at 1900 Broadway (virtual/in-person option)
- **$100+**: Beta access to HealthClock app or one-on-one longevity discussion

**Every dollar helps.** If you can't donate, sharing this campaign with your networks is equally valuable—I know many of you are connected to people who care about longevity and community resilience.

I'll provide transparent updates every 2-3 days on campaign progress and exactly how funds are used.

**Thank you for considering supporting me during this vulnerable moment.** This community has given me so much—your support would allow me to keep giving back.

With gratitude,
[Your Name]

*P.S. – My birthday is October 4, right in the middle of this campaign. The best gift would be knowing I have stable housing to continue this work.*

## Revised Video Script (90 seconds MAX)

### [0-15 seconds: Hook + Crisis]
"Hi, I'm [Name]. I have until October 9—that's 7 days—to come up with $2,400 or I lose my housing in Oakland. I'm reaching out to the longevity community because you've seen the work I do."

### [15-45 seconds: Context]
"Over the past year, I've been building longevity community in the Bay Area—organizing dinners at Viva Frontier Tower, connecting people at Vitalist Bay, hosting meetups at 1900 Broadway. I've been developing HealthClock and bioviz.tech imaging technology. But a contract payment fell through, and in July I was hospitalized for a week with cellulitis, which depleted my savings. Now I'm facing a $1,576 lease deposit I don't have."

### [45-70 seconds: What's at stake]
"If I can raise $2,400 by October 9, I stay housed and keep working on these projects. If not, I lose my home and these community initiatives stall. I'm not asking for money without giving back—donors get early access to HealthClock, invites to meetups, and project insights."

### [70-90 seconds: Call to action]
"Can you donate $10, $25, $50? Or share this with someone in your network who cares about longevity and community? Link is below. Even $10 makes a real difference. Thank you for being part of this community—let's keep it going together."

### [Optional final 5 seconds if you want the "42" reference]
"And for any Hitchhiker's Guide fans—if we hit $4,200, we'll have found the answer to life, the universe, and keeping me housed."

### For LinkedIn

"I'm reaching out to my professional network during a vulnerable moment.

Due to an unexpected contract payment issue, I'm facing a housing crisis in Oakland. I need to raise $2,400 by October 9 for a lease deposit to avoid losing my home.

Over the past year, I've been building longevity community infrastructure in the Bay Area—organizing events at Viva Frontier Tower and 1900 Broadway, and developing HealthClock (health tracking app) and bioviz.tech (FRO imaging for longevity research).

I'm asking for support to stay housed so I can continue this work: [GoFundMe link]

If you've appreciated my contributions to the longevity community, or simply believe in supporting community builders during crisis, any donation ($10, $25, $50+) or share helps.
