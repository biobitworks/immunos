## 🎯 GOAL OPTIONS

### Option A: Minimum Survival ($1,641)
**What it covers:**
- ✅ Deposit to Jerry: $1,326
- ✅ Cash App payment: $315
- ❌ No computer replacement (must delay or borrow)
- ❌ No medical expense buffer

**After GoFundMe fees (2.9% + $0.30):**
- Raised: $1,641
- Fees: ~$48
- Net to you: **$1,593**
- **SHORTFALL: -$48** (need to cover from contract work invoice of $250)

**Pros:**
- Most achievable in 7 days
- Focuses on absolute critical deadlines (Jerry + Cash App)

**Cons:**
- No computer (income generation blocked)
- No medical expense buffer (ongoing $20-50/week)
- Cuts it extremely close

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **Too risky** - leaves no room for error

---

### Option B: Essentials + Computer ($2,500)
**What it covers:**
- ✅ Deposit to Jerry: $1,326
- ✅ Cash App payment: $315
- ✅ Computer replacement: $700 (mid-range laptop)
- ✅ Medical buffer (4 weeks): $159

**After GoFundMe fees:**
- Raised: $2,500
- Fees: ~$73
- Net to you: **$2,427**
- **Covers:** All critical expenses + 4 weeks medical

**Breakdown after fees:**
- Jerry: $1,326 ✅
- Cash App: $315 ✅
- Computer: $700 ✅
- Medical (Oct): $86 remaining ✅

**Pros:**
- Covers all Oct 9-17 deadlines
- Computer allows contract work income continuation
- Small medical buffer for October
- Realistic to achieve in 7 days with strong network

**Cons:**
- Tight budget, no cushion for unexpected
- Medical buffer only covers 4 weeks

**Verdict:** ✅ **RECOMMENDED MINIMUM** - achievable and covers essentials

---

### Option C: Full Stabilization ($3,500)
**What it covers:**
- ✅ Deposit to Jerry: $1,326
- ✅ Cash App payment: $315
- ✅ Computer replacement: $800 (better laptop)
- ✅ Medical buffer (8 weeks): $300
- ✅ Emergency buffer: $759

**After GoFundMe fees:**
- Raised: $3,500
- Fees: ~$102
- Net to you: **$3,398**

**Breakdown after fees:**
- Jerry: $1,326 ✅
- Cash App: $315 ✅
- Computer: $800 ✅
- Medical (Oct-Nov): $300 ✅
- Emergency cushion: $657 ✅

**Emergency cushion could cover:**
- Unexpected medical expenses
- Contract work delays (if $250 invoice delayed)
- November expenses if needed
- Transportation beyond medical (job interviews, networking)

**Pros:**
- Full coverage for 8-10 weeks
- Quality computer for contract work
- Emergency buffer for unexpected
- Less stress, more breathing room

**Cons:**
- Harder to achieve in 7 days
- May fall short of goal (looks like failure)
- Higher amount may deter some small donors

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **IDEAL but risky** - only if you have network of 300+ people

---

### Option D: Extended Stabilization + November ($4,500)
**What it covers:**
- ✅ All of Option C +
- ✅ November rent: $1,300
- ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED** - see reasoning below

**Why NOT recommended:**
1. **Dilutes urgency** - "Need by Oct 9" vs "Want November rent covered"
2. **November rent not due until Nov 1** - can raise separately if needed
3. **Harder to justify** - donors question why you need 6+ weeks of expenses
4. **Benefits risk** - larger amount sitting in account = CalFresh scrutiny
5. **Lower success rate** - $4,500 in 7 days requires 150+ donors @ $30 average

**Alternative strategy:**
- Run $2,500 campaign now (Oct 2-9)
- If successful, run mini-campaign in late October for November rent
- Separate emergencies = separate campaigns = clearer asks

**Verdict:** ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED** for Oct 2-9 campaign

- Expect to raise: $1,500-2,500
- Good chance of hitting goal

**If you have 200-500 strong connections:**
- Set goal: $3,000-3,500
- Expect to raise: $2,000-3,500
- Great chance of hitting or exceeding goal

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### **RECOMMENDED GOAL: $2,500**

**Rationale:**
1. **Covers all critical Oct 9-17 expenses** ($1,326 + $315 + $700 = $2,341 before fees)
2. **Computer replacement included** (critical for contract work income)
3. **Small medical buffer** ($80-150 for October)
4. **Realistic for 7-day campaign** (need ~80 donors @ $31 average)
5. **Clear, justified ask** (can document every expense)
6. **Benefits-safe** (under $5,000 IRS threshold, spend immediately)

**Messaging:**
"I need $2,500 by October 9 to cover:
- $1,326 housing deposit (due to roommate by Oct 9)
- $315 credit card payment (due Oct 17, not flexible)
- $700 computer replacement (current must return Oct 9, needed for contract work)
- $159 medical expenses (ongoing wound care, BART to SF doctors)"

**After GoFundMe fees (2.9% + $0.30):**
- Raised: $2,500
- Fees: ~$73
- Net: $2,427
- Expenses: $2,341 (critical) + $86 (medical) = **Fully covered**

---

### Alternative: Stretch Goal Strategy

**Primary goal: $2,000** (conservative, high success probability)
**Stretch goal: $2,500** (ideal, includes computer + medical)
**Dream goal: $3,000** (full buffer, 8 weeks medical)

**Messaging approach:**
- Main campaign copy focuses on $2,000 critical needs
- Updates mention: "We're 75% to our stretch goal of $2,500, which would cover a computer replacement for my contract work!"
- Creates momentum without setting unrealistic expectation

**Pros of stretch goal approach:**
- Lower initial goal = higher perceived success
- Hitting $2,000 looks like victory, creates momentum
- $2,500 stretch goal incentivizes additional donations
- $3,000 dream goal catches windfall donors

**Cons:**
- More complex messaging
- Some platforms don't support stretch goals well
- May confuse donors ("How much do you really need?")

**Verdict:** Consider if your network is <150 people. Otherwise, stick with clear $2,500 goal.

## 💡 STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Fee Optimization

**GoFundMe fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction**

**To net $2,427 (full expenses), you need to raise:**
$2,427 ÷ 0.971 = $2,500 (rounded)

**Donor tip option:**
- GoFundMe asks donors to "cover fees" (optional tip)
- ~30-40% of donors opt in
- Can reduce your out-of-pocket fee burden
- **Don't rely on this** - assume you pay full fees

### Tax Optimization

**IRS Form 1099-K thresholds:**
- **2024 tax year:** $5,000+ triggers 1099-K
- **2025 tax year:** $20,000+ OR 200+ transactions

**Your goal of $2,500:**
- ✅ Under $5,000 threshold for 2024
- ✅ Under $20,000 threshold for 2025
- ✅ Likely <200 transactions (expect 60-100 donors)
- **Result:** Probably no 1099-K, but even if you get one, report as non-taxable personal gifts

### Benefits Safety

**CalFresh income limit:** $2,510/month gross

**Your monthly income:**
- SSDI: $_____ (you haven't told me yet)
- Contract work: ~$250/month
- GoFundMe: **$0 countable** (one-time personal gift)
- **Total countable:** SSDI + $250

**As long as SSDI + $250 < $2,510, you're fine for CalFresh.**

**One-time funds in account:**
- California has NO ASSET TEST for CalFresh (as of Jan 2024)
- $2,427 sitting in account briefly = not a problem
- Spend on stated purposes within October = ideal

## 📋 WHAT YOUR DONORS ARE PAYING FOR

### Clear Expense Justification ($2,500 goal)

**Housing stability ($1,326):**
- "My roommate Jerome needs $1,326 by Oct 9 to cover the increased security deposit to keep me on the lease. Without this, I lose my housing."

**Credit card payment ($315):**
- "I have a $315 credit card payment due Oct 17 with no flexibility. Late payment means penalties and interest that compound the problem."

**Income generation tool ($700):**
- "My current computer must be returned by Oct 9. I need a replacement to continue my contract work (already invoiced $250 this month). A computer is essential for remote work income."

**Medical expenses ($159):**
- "I'm recovering from July hospitalization (cellulitis). I have ongoing wound care and need to travel to SF doctors via BART, costing $20-50/week. This covers October expenses."

**Total:** $2,500
**GoFundMe fees:** ~$73
**Net to you:** $2,427
**Fully covers:** All expenses above

**Donor psychology:**
- ✅ Specific amounts (not rounded "about $2,000")
- ✅ Clear deadlines (Oct 9, Oct 17)
- ✅ Documented needs (housing, medical, work equipment)
- ✅ Investment in self-sufficiency (computer = income generation)
- ✅ Under $3,000 (feels achievable, not overwhelming)

---

## ✅ DECISION: Set Goal at $2,500

**Next steps:**
1. Confirm network size (LinkedIn + Instagram + Facebook + Telegram + Viva/Vitalist contacts)
2. If network <150 people, consider lowering to $2,000
3. If network 200+ people, confident in $2,500
4. If network 400+ people, could push to $3,000 (includes 8-week medical buffer)

**Most likely outcome with $2,500 goal:**
- Raise: $1,800-2,600 (based on typical 7-day campaign)
- If you hit $2,000, you cover Jerry + Cash App + Computer (success!)
- If you hit $2,500, you cover everything + medical (ideal!)
- If you raise $1,500, you negotiate with Jerry for partial payment + payment plan
