# SSI Eligibility Analysis

**Your Situation:**
- Current SSDI: $1,199/month
- Question: Can you also receive SSI?

**Answer: YES, you may qualify for concurrent SSDI + SSI benefits!**

---

## 💰 YOUR CURRENT INCOME

### SSDI Breakdown:
- **Monthly SSDI:** $1,199
- **Annual SSDI:** $14,388

### Additional Income:
- **Contract work:** ~$250/month variable
- **Total monthly income:** $1,199 + $250 = **$1,449/month**

## ✅ SSI ELIGIBILITY - YOU MAY QUALIFY

### What is SSI?

**SSI (Supplemental Security Income)** is a needs-based program that supplements income for disabled individuals with limited income and resources.

### 2025 SSI Income Limits:

**Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) for 2025:**
- Individual: **$967/month** maximum SSI payment
- Couple: $1,450/month

### How SSI Calculates Your Eligibility:

**Formula:** SSI payment = FBR - (Countable Income - Deductions)

**Your calculation:**
1. **Gross SSDI:** $1,199/month
2. **General income exclusion:** -$20 (SSA doesn't count first $20)
3. **Countable SSDI:** $1,179/month
4. **Contract work:** $250/month
5. **Earned income exclusion:** -$65 (first $65 not counted)
6. **Remaining earned income:** $185
7. **Half of remaining earned:** $185 ÷ 2 = $92.50 (only half counts)
8. **Total countable income:** $1,179 + $92.50 = **$1,271.50**

**SSI Eligibility Check:**
- FBR: $967
- Your countable income: $1,271.50
- **Difference:** -$304.50

**Result:** ❌ **You do NOT qualify for SSI** with your current income level.

**Why:** Your countable income ($1,271.50) exceeds the maximum SSI payment ($967), so you wouldn't receive any SSI benefits.

## 📊 INCOME SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: SSDI Only (No Contract Work)
- SSDI: $1,199/month
- General exclusion: -$20
- Countable income: $1,179
- FBR: $967
- **Result:** Still $212 over limit, NO SSI

### Scenario 2: If SSDI Were Lower
**To qualify for ANY SSI, your SSDI would need to be:**
- FBR $967 + $20 general exclusion = $987/month or less
- Your SSDI ($1,199) is $212 too high

### Scenario 3: If You Had NO Income
- You would receive full SSI: $967/month
- But you have SSDI: $1,199/month (which is higher, so better!)

## 🔍 CONCURRENT BENEFITS EXPLAINED

### Who Receives Both SSDI and SSI?

People can receive **concurrent benefits** (both SSDI and SSI) if:
1. They qualify for SSDI based on work history
2. Their SSDI payment is LOW (typically under $987/month for 2025)
3. They have limited resources (under $2,000 for individual)

**Example:**
- Person receives SSDI: $600/month
- Countable income: $600 - $20 = $580
- SSI eligibility: $967 - $580 = **$387/month SSI supplement**
- **Total monthly income:** $600 SSDI + $387 SSI = $987

### Why Concurrent Benefits Exist:

SSDI is based on your work history and earnings. If you:
- Became disabled young (limited work history)
- Had low earnings when you worked
- Didn't work long enough for higher SSDI

Then SSDI alone might not be enough to live on, so SSI supplements it up to the FBR.

## 💡 YOUR SITUATION - GOOD NEWS!

### Why You're NOT Eligible for SSI (And That's Actually Good):

**Your SSDI ($1,199) is HIGHER than the maximum SSI ($967).**

This means:
- ✅ Your SSDI benefit is actually decent
- ✅ You earned enough work credits for a higher payment
- ✅ You're $232/month better off than max SSI recipients
- ✅ You avoid SSI's strict asset limits ($2,000)
- ✅ You avoid SSI's complex income reporting requirements

### SSI Would Only Help If:
- Your SSDI was under ~$987/month, OR
- You had NO work history (SSDI = $0)

Since your SSDI is $1,199, you're already getting MORE than SSI could provide.

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION: DON'T APPLY FOR SSI

### Why You Shouldn't Pursue SSI:

1. **You don't qualify** - Income too high ($1,199 SSDI + $250 work = $1,449 total)
2. **Not worth the hassle** - Would need to reduce income below ~$987/month to get any SSI
3. **Asset limits** - SSI has $2,000 asset limit (SSDI doesn't)
4. **Complex reporting** - SSI requires reporting every income/asset change monthly
5. **GoFundMe risk** - SSI counts assets (SSDI doesn't), making crowdfunding riskier

### What You Should Focus On Instead:

**Maximize your current situation:**
- ✅ Keep SSDI ($1,199/month, no asset limits)
- ✅ Grow contract work (can earn up to $1,550/month without affecting SSDI)
- ✅ Use GoFundMe safely (doesn't affect SSDI, CalFresh, or Medi-Cal)
- ✅ Maintain CalFresh (extra $200-300/month food assistance)
- ✅ Keep Medi-Cal (free healthcare)

**Income optimization:**
- Current: $1,199 SSDI + $250 contract = $1,449/month
- Potential: $1,199 SSDI + $1,550 contract = $2,749/month
- **You can TRIPLE your contract work income** (from $250 to $1,550) without affecting SSDI!

## 💰 INCOME OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITY

### SSDI Trial Work Period (TWP):

**You may have unused Trial Work Period months!**

**What is TWP?**
- SSA gives you 9 months (not necessarily consecutive) to test your ability to work
- During TWP, you can earn ANY amount without losing SSDI
- After TWP, you can still earn up to $1,550/month (SGA limit) indefinitely

**Your situation:**
- Contract work: $250/month (well under $1,550 SGA)
- You have room to earn **$1,300 MORE per month** without affecting SSDI

**Action:** Check if you've used your TWP months
- Call SSA: 1-800-772-1213
- Ask: "How many Trial Work Period months have I used?"
- If you have unused TWP months, you could even exceed $1,550 temporarily

## ✅ SUMMARY - BOTTOM LINE

### Can You Receive SSI?
**NO** - Your SSDI ($1,199) + contract work ($250) = $1,449/month, which is too high to qualify for SSI.

### Is This a Problem?
**NO** - You're actually BETTER OFF with SSDI alone than with SSDI + SSI because:
- Your SSDI ($1,199) > Max SSI ($967)
- No asset limits (SSI has $2,000 limit)
- Simpler reporting (SSI is complex)
- GoFundMe safer (SSI counts assets)

### Should You Apply for SSI?
**NO** - You won't qualify, and even if you did (by reducing income), you'd be worse off financially.

### What Should You Do Instead?
1. **Maximize contract work** - Can earn up to $1,550/month without affecting SSDI
2. **Run GoFundMe safely** - SSDI unaffected by personal gifts
3. **Maintain CalFresh/Medi-Cal** - You're well under income limits
4. **Check Trial Work Period status** - May have unused months for higher earnings

### Your Current Benefits Are Solid:
- ✅ SSDI: $1,199/month (stable, no asset limits)
- ✅ Medicare: Full coverage
- ✅ CalFresh: ~$200-300/month food assistance
- ✅ Medi-Cal: Free healthcare
- ✅ Room to grow: Can earn $1,300 MORE per month from work

**You're in good shape. Don't complicate it with SSI application.**
