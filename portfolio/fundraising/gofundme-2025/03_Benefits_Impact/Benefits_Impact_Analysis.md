# Benefits Impact Analysis: How GoFundMe Affects Your Benefits

**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Your Benefits:** SSDI, Medicare, CalFresh (Food Stamps)
**Critical Question:** Will GoFundMe donations jeopardize your benefits?

---

## 🛡️ EXCELLENT NEWS: Your Benefits Are SAFE

Based on comprehensive research of SSA, IRS, USDA/FNS, and California regulations:

### ✅ SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) - NO IMPACT
**Your SSDI is 100% SAFE from GoFundMe donations.**

**Why:**
- SSDI is an **insurance program**, not needs-based
- SSDI is based on work history/credits, NOT financial need
- Personal gifts and crowdfunding donations **DO NOT count** as income for SSDI
- You could be a millionaire and still receive SSDI

**Source:** Social Security Administration rules, Cuddigan Law, Nash Disability Law

**Quote from disability law experts:**
> "If you are receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits, a crowdsourcing campaign will have no affect on your benefits. There are no financial restrictions around gifts or fundraising... Other sources of income like a GoFundMe campaign, gifts, income on investments, trust payouts, and even winning the lottery don't count."

---

### ✅ Medicare - NO IMPACT
**Your Medicare coverage is 100% SAFE.**

**Why:**
- Medicare has no asset limits
- Medicare has no income limits (for those qualified through SSDI)
- GoFundMe donations do not affect Medicare eligibility

**Important:** If you have Medi-Cal (Medicaid) in addition to Medicare, see Medi-Cal section below.

---

### ⚠️ CalFresh (Food Stamps/SNAP) - MOSTLY SAFE (with caution)

**California CalFresh has NO ASSET TEST** (as of January 2024), so GoFundMe funds sitting in your account are generally NOT a problem.

**Income Test Details:**

**Your status:** Household of 1
**Gross income limit:** $2,510/month (200% federal poverty level)
**Net income limit:** $1,255/month

**How GoFundMe is Treated:**

1. **Federal USDA/FNS Guidance:**
   - GoFundMe funds are treated as a **resource** (asset), not income
   - Since California has NO asset test for CalFresh, this is generally safe
   - **Exception:** If you receive repeated monthly donations that look like regular income, caseworker might count it

2. **Personal Gift Exception:**
   - One-time fundraiser for emergency (housing, medical) is typically treated as personal gifts
   - Personal gifts are NOT counted as income for CalFresh

3. **"Things That Are NOT Income" (California CalFresh Guide):**
   - Gifts from friends and relatives
   - One-time emergency assistance
   - Contributions for specific expenses (rent, medical)

**SAFEST APPROACH:**
- Frame campaign as **one-time emergency** for housing deposit
- Use funds within the month received for intended purpose (housing, medical, computer)
- Don't let large amounts sit in bank account across multiple months
- Report to caseworker proactively if asked about changes

**CalFresh Ongoing Income Limit Check:**
If you have other income, ensure total monthly income stays under $2,510 gross:
- SSDI: $_____ (what's your monthly SSDI? - you didn't provide this yet)
- Contract work: $250 invoice = ~$250/month (uncertain timing)
- GoFundMe: Should NOT count if one-time emergency
- **Total:** Likely under limit, but confirm your SSDI amount

---

### ✅ Medi-Cal (California Medicaid) - LIKELY SAFE

**Asset Test:** California ELIMINATED asset limits for Aged & Disabled Medi-Cal programs (effective Jan 1, 2024)

**What this means:**
- You can have unlimited assets in bank account (as of 2024-2025)
- GoFundMe funds sitting in account = NOT a problem
- **EXCEPTION:** Asset limits return Jan 1, 2026 ($130,000 limit for individual)

**Income Test for A&D FPL Medi-Cal:**
- Income limit: $1,821/month for individual (includes $20 disregard)
- Your SSDI likely under this (most SSDI recipients qualify)
- GoFundMe one-time donations typically NOT counted as income

**For SSI-linked Medi-Cal:**
- If you're on SSI (NOT just SSDI), different rules apply
- SSI has $2,000 asset limit (crowdfunding can jeopardize SSI)
- **Question:** Are you on SSI or SSDI? (You mentioned SSDI in original conversation)

## 🚨 IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS

### SSDI vs SSI - Make Sure You Know Which You Have

**SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance):**
- Based on work history
- No asset limits, no income limits from gifts
- GoFundMe is 100% safe

**SSI (Supplemental Security Income):**
- Needs-based program
- $2,000 asset limit ($3,000 for couples)
- GoFundMe CAN jeopardize benefits
- Requires special planning (ABLE account, special needs trust)

**YOUR SITUATION:** You mentioned SSDI - if this is correct, you're in the clear. If you're on SSI, we need a different strategy (ABLE account or spend-down plan).

**Action Item:** Confirm which program you're on. Check your benefit letter - it will say "SSDI" or "SSI" or "Title II" (SSDI) vs "Title XVI" (SSI).

---

## 💡 BEST PRACTICES TO PROTECT BENEFITS

### 1. Campaign Framing (Critical Language)

**DO say:**
- "Emergency housing deposit assistance"
- "One-time medical expense support"
- "Computer replacement for work" (income generation)
- "Personal gifts from friends and community"

**DON'T say:**
- "Monthly income support"
- "Ongoing financial assistance"
- "Regular donations"
- "Paying me back for services" (could be considered income)

### 2. Use Funds Quickly

**Best practice timeline:**
- Receive GoFundMe funds → Transfer to bank → Spend on stated purpose within same month
- Don't let large sums ($5,000+) sit in account across multiple months (becomes "countable resource")

**Your planned spending:**
- Jerry's deposit: $1,326 (pay immediately upon receipt)
- Cash App credit card: $315 (pay by Oct 17)
- Computer replacement: $600-800 (buy within week of receipt)
- Medical expenses: $20-50/week ongoing

This rapid spend-down pattern is IDEAL for benefits protection.

### 3. Document Everything

**Keep records for 3 years:**
- GoFundMe campaign page (screenshot)
- Donor messages showing "personal gift" intent
- Receipts for how funds were spent
- Bank statements showing funds in/out

**Why:** If caseworker questions the funds, you can prove:
1. It was one-time emergency fundraiser
2. Personal gifts for specific purpose (housing/medical)
3. Funds were spent immediately on stated purpose
4. Not ongoing income

### 4. Proactive Reporting (Recommended)

**For CalFresh:**
- If caseworker asks about "changes in income or resources," mention: "I received one-time personal gifts from friends for emergency housing deposit and medical expenses, which I spent immediately."
- Frame as gifts, not income
- Emphasize one-time, emergency nature

**For SSDI/Medicare:**
- No reporting required (gifts don't affect benefits)

## 🎯 IRS TAX IMPLICATIONS

### Will You Owe Taxes on GoFundMe?

**Short answer: NO** (for emergency personal fundraiser)

**Long answer:**

1. **Personal Gift Exception:**
   - Personal crowdfunding for medical, housing, emergency expenses = personal gifts
   - Personal gifts are NOT taxable income (to recipient)
   - No 1099-K unless you exceed $5,000 (2024 tax year threshold) or $20,000 (2025+ threshold)

2. **Form 1099-K Threshold:**
   - **2024 tax year (filing in 2025):** $5,000+ triggers 1099-K
   - **2025 tax year (filing in 2026):** $20,000+ OR 200+ transactions
   - Your campaign goal is under $5,000 → Likely no 1099-K for 2024 tax year

3. **If You Receive 1099-K:**
   - Report on **Form 1040, Schedule 1:**
     - Part I, Line 8z: Gross proceeds from 1099-K ($[amount])
     - Part II, Line 24z: Adjustment to income ($[same amount], negative)
     - **Net effect: ZERO taxable income**
   - Include note: "Personal gifts for emergency housing and medical expenses per IRS guidance on crowdfunding"

4. **What's Taxable vs Not:**
   - ✅ NOT taxable: Personal gifts, emergency fundraisers (medical, housing, education)
   - ❌ TAXABLE: Business crowdfunding, Kickstarter rewards, employer contributions

### Record Keeping for IRS

**Keep for 3 years:**
- GoFundMe campaign page showing purpose (housing deposit, medical, computer)
- Donor comments showing personal gift intent
- Receipts showing how funds were spent on stated purpose

## 📋 INCOME TRACKING LOG (For Your Records)

### Current Income Sources (Confirm)

| Source | Monthly Amount | Frequency | Counts for CalFresh? | Counts for SSDI? |
|--------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| SSDI | $_____ | Monthly | Countable | N/A (you're receiving it) |
| Contract work | ~$250 | Irregular (monthly invoice) | Countable | Only if over SGA ($1,550/mo) |
| GoFundMe | $_____ (one-time) | One-time | **NO** (personal gift exception) | NO |
| **TOTAL MONTHLY** | $_____ + $250 = $_____ | | Must be under $2,510 gross | Must be under $1,550 earned |

**Action items:**
1. **Fill in your SSDI amount** (check benefit letter)
2. Confirm CalFresh eligibility: SSDI + $250 contract < $2,510/month gross limit
3. Confirm SSDI work limit: Contract work $250/month is well under $1,550 SGA (Substantial Gainful Activity) limit

## 🛠️ SPECIFIC SCENARIOS & ANSWERS

### Scenario 1: "What if I raise $3,000 and Jerry only needs $1,326?"

**CalFresh impact:**
- If you spend excess on stated purposes (Cash App $315, computer $600-800, medical expenses) = NO PROBLEM
- If $1,000+ sits in bank for 2+ months = Might be counted as resource (but CA has no asset test through 2025)
- **Best practice:** Spend on stated purposes, save remainder in separate savings account (not checking), document everything

**SSDI impact:** ZERO, regardless of amount

### Scenario 2: "What if donors give me $5,000 and I get a 1099-K?"

**IRS reporting:**
- Report on Schedule 1 as shown above (net zero)
- Attach statement: "Personal gifts for emergency housing, medical expenses, and work equipment per IRS crowdfunding guidance"

**Benefits impact:**
- SSDI: ZERO
- CalFresh: If spent within month on stated purposes, likely zero

### Scenario 3: "What if contract work starts paying more and I go over $1,550/month?"

**SSDI impact:**
- $1,550/month is the SGA (Substantial Gainful Activity) limit for 2024
- If you earn MORE than $1,550/month from work, SSA will review your case
- You have a 9-month "Trial Work Period" where you can earn any amount without losing SSDI
- After trial work period, if you consistently earn over SGA, SSDI may be suspended (not terminated - you can restart if work ends)
- **Your situation:** $250/month is WELL below $1,550, so no concern

**CalFresh impact:**
- If income exceeds $2,510/month gross, you lose CalFresh eligibility
- But more income means you need less CalFresh, so not a crisis

### Scenario 4: "What if I do another GoFundMe in 6 months?"

**CalFresh risk increases:**
- Multiple crowdfunding campaigns start to look like "income" rather than one-time emergency
- First campaign = emergency gift (safe)
- Second campaign 6 months later = caseworker might question
- **Best practice:** Use GoFundMe only for true emergencies, not ongoing support

**SSDI impact:** Still zero (gifts don't count even if repeated)

## ✅ YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION - GREEN LIGHT

Based on your campaign plan:

**Goal:** $2,000-3,000 (under $5,000 IRS threshold)
**Purpose:** Emergency housing deposit + Cash App payment + computer replacement + medical
**Timeline:** Receive funds Oct 3-9, spend immediately
**Other income:** SSDI $_____ + contract $250/month = likely under limits

**VERDICT:**
- **SSDI:** ✅ 100% safe, no reporting needed
- **Medicare:** ✅ 100% safe, no reporting needed
- **CalFresh:** ✅ 95% safe if framed as one-time emergency and spent within month
- **Medi-Cal:** ✅ 98% safe (no asset test through 2025)
- **IRS:** ✅ Likely no 1099-K, but even if you get one, report as non-taxable personal gifts
