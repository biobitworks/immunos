- **Already paid:** $250 deposit (Sept 19)
- **Total deposit you'll have paid:** $1,576

## 💡 Strategic Notes

### Why This Campaign Is Different:
- **Time pressure:** Jerry needs payment by Oct 9 (6 days after launch)
- **Loan repayment:** You're repaying Jerry, not paying landlord directly
- **Benefits risk:** Must structure carefully to not lose SSDI/Medicare/CalFresh
- **Multiple expenses:** Not just deposit - also Cash App, computer, medical
- **Income uncertainty:** New contract job, monthly pay cycle

### Key Messaging Points:
- Operations Manager at Viva (not just volunteer)
- Medical recovery ongoing (BART to SF, wound care)
- Computer needed for contract work (income generation)
- Living in Oakland to build longevity community
- 1900 Broadway has event spaces for community building
