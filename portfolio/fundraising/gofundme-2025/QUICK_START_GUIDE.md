## 🚨 URGENT: Critical Questions to Answer First

The wealth-architect-strategist agent needs this information to build your action plan. **Answer these 5 priority questions immediately:**

### 1. Housing Breakdown
- **What exactly is the $1,576 for?** (First month? Last month? Deposit? Combination?)
- **Current vs new housing?** Are you preventing eviction from your current place, or securing a new place?
- **Have you asked your landlord** for a payment plan or delayed deadline?

### 2. SSDI Details
- **Monthly SSDI amount:** $_____
- **How long have you been receiving SSDI?** (This matters for student loan discharge - if 5+ years, you may qualify to eliminate $130K)
- **SSDI start date:** ______

### 3. Emergency Resources Status
Have you contacted these Oakland programs yet?
- [ ] Alameda County ERAP (Emergency Rental Assistance)
- [ ] Oakland Housing Authority
- [ ] 211 Bay Area (call this number for instant referrals)
- [ ] Catholic Charities East Bay Emergency Assistance
- [ ] Bay Area Legal Aid (tenant rights)

### 4. Contract Work Income
- **Current client(s):** Who pays you $50-100/hour?
- **Why is it inconsistent?** (Their budget issues? Your availability? Need more clients?)
- **Outstanding invoices:** Does anyone currently owe you money?

### 5. Community Direct Ask
- **Have you directly asked** Viva Frontier Tower, Vitalist Bay, or 1900 Broadway community members for emergency help (loans, temporary housing, immediate donations)?
- **If yes, what were their responses?**
- **If no, why not?** (This could be your fastest path to $2,400)

**Once you answer these, Claude's wealth-architect-strategist agent will deliver your hour-by-hour action plan.**

## 🎯 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Answer the 5 Critical Questions Above ⬆️

**Why this matters:**
- Determines if you should set goal at $2,400 or $4,200
- Unlocks $130K student loan discharge opportunity (if SSDI 5+ years)
- Identifies faster paths to money than GoFundMe (emergency programs, community loans)
- Prevents TOS violations and wasted effort

**How to provide answers:**
Type them directly in your next message to Claude, or create a file:
```bash
# Option 1: Type answers in chat

# Option 2: Create answers file
nano ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/DISCOVERY_ANSWERS.md
# (Paste answers, save with Ctrl+X)
```

---

### Step 2: Upload Files to `assets/` Folder

**Priority uploads (do this TODAY):**

#### 📸 Photos (for campaign image)
```bash
# Upload 3-5 photos of you at community events
cp ~/Pictures/[your-photos].jpg ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/assets/photos/

# Claude will analyze and recommend the best one
```

**What makes a good photo:**
- Your face is clearly visible
- You're engaged in community activity (cooking, event hosting, meetup)
- Warm, authentic emotion (not posed/corporate)
- Good lighting, in-focus
- Other people visible (shows community connection)

#### 📄 Financial Documents (for strategy analysis)
```bash
# Upload these if you have them:
cp ~/Documents/ssdi-award-letter.pdf ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/assets/documents/
cp ~/Documents/bank-statements-recent.pdf ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/assets/documents/
cp ~/Documents/lease-agreement.pdf ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/assets/documents/
cp ~/Documents/hospital-bills-july.pdf ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/assets/documents/
```

**What Claude will do:**
- Calculate exact income/expenses
- Identify emergency program eligibility
- Check for student loan discharge qualification
- Find legal optimization opportunities
- Build realistic fundraising model

#### 📊 Network Data (for outreach strategy)
```bash
# Export LinkedIn connections to CSV, then:
cp ~/Downloads/linkedin-connections.csv ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/assets/data/

# Create a simple contact list:
nano ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/assets/data/viva-vitalist-contacts.csv
```

**Contact list format (CSV):**
```csv
Name,Relationship,Platform,Donation_Likelihood,Notes
"Sarah Chen","Close friend from Viva","Telegram","High","Attended 5+ dinners I cooked"
"Dr. Michael Ross","Vitalist Bay connection","LinkedIn","Medium","Longevity researcher, met 2x"
"Jamie Park","1900 Broadway meetup regular","Instagram","Low","Came to 1 meetup, engaged with content"
```

Claude will use this to:
- Prioritize who to DM first
- Calculate realistic fundraising potential
- Generate personalized message templates
- Optimize contact timing

---

### Step 3: Get Your Wealth Strategy Report

Once you've answered the 5 critical questions and uploaded files, tell Claude:

**"Analyze my situation and create my financial strategy reports. I've answered the discovery questions and uploaded files to assets/. Generate:
1. Crisis triage plan (next 7 days)
2. Realistic fundraising goal recommendation
3. Emergency resource applications
4. Backup plans if GoFundMe falls short
5. Long-term wealth transition strategy"**

Claude will generate:
- `financial-strategy/crisis-triage.md` - Hour-by-hour action plan
- `financial-strategy/backup-plans.md` - Plans B, C, D
- `assets/analysis/financial-forensics-report.md` - Complete breakdown
- `assets/analysis/emergency-resources-match.md` - Oakland programs you qualify for

---

### Step 4: Finalize Campaign Copy

After reviewing your wealth strategy, decide:
- **Goal:** $2,400 or $4,200?
- **Theme:** Remove "42" reference entirely, or keep one casual mention?
- **Story emphasis:** Focus on hospitalization? Community contribution? Both?

Tell Claude:
**"Create my final campaign copy in `campaign-drafts/final-version.md` with:
- Goal: $[2,400 or 4,200]
- Emphasize [hospitalization / community work / longevity projects]
- Tone: [urgent and direct / warm and community-focused / balanced]"**

---

### Step 5: Create Video Script & Film

**Tell Claude:**
**"Generate my 90-second video script based on my final campaign copy and uploaded photos. Include:
- Exact hook (first 5 seconds)
- Story beats with timestamps
- Emotional moments to emphasize
- Call-to-action wording
- B-roll suggestions"**

Claude will create: `messaging/video-scripts.md`

**Then film your video:**
- Use your phone (portrait or landscape, both work)
- Find good natural lighting (near window, or outside)
- Quiet location (minimal background noise)
- Film 2-3 takes (Claude can review and recommend best one)
- Keep it under 90 seconds (shorter is better for completion rate)

**Upload raw footage:**
```bash
cp ~/Videos/gofundme-pitch-take1.mp4 ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/assets/videos/
cp ~/Videos/gofundme-pitch-take2.mp4 ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/assets/videos/
```

**Ask Claude:** "Review my video takes and recommend which one to use, or suggest a hybrid edit."

---

### Step 6: Generate Channel-Specific Messaging

**Tell Claude:**
**"Create all my outreach templates in the `messaging/` folder:
1. Telegram group posts (for Viva, Vitalist, longevity groups)
2. LinkedIn professional post
3. DM templates for close contacts (personalized by relationship)
4. Facebook post (if applicable)
5. Instagram story script
6. Email template for people not on social media"**

Claude will generate:
- `messaging/telegram-templates.md` - 3-5 variations
- `messaging/linkedin-posts.md` - Professional version
- `messaging/dm-templates.md` - Personalized by relationship tier
- `messaging/update-templates.md` - Daily progress updates

---

### Step 7: Set Up Tracking System

**Tell Claude:**
**"Create my donor tracking spreadsheet and timeline checklist in `tracking/`:
1. Donor tracker with columns: Name, Amount, Date, Channel, Thank-you sent
2. Daily action checklist (Oct 2-9)
3. Success metrics dashboard"**

Claude will generate:
- `tracking/donor-tracker.csv` - Track every donation
- `tracking/timeline-checklist.md` - What to do each day
- `tracking/metrics.md` - KPIs to monitor (goal: Day 1 = $300-500, Day 3 = $1000+, Day 7 = $2000+)

---

### Step 8: Launch GoFundMe (Target: TODAY by 2 PM PDT)

**Pre-launch checklist:**
- [ ] Final campaign copy reviewed
- [ ] Best photo selected
- [ ] 90-second video filmed and uploaded
- [ ] All messaging templates ready
- [ ] Donor tracking spreadsheet created
- [ ] First 10-15 contacts identified for immediate outreach

**Create GoFundMe page:**
1. Go to https://www.gofundme.com/create
2. Select "Emergency" category
3. Set location: Oakland, CA
4. Paste final campaign copy
5. Upload photo and video
6. Set goal: $2,400 or $4,200 (based on strategy)
7. Set to "Flexible Funding" (keep all donations)
8. Review for TOS compliance (no "repay" language)
9. **Publish**

**Save your campaign URL:**
```bash
# Create a file with your live link
echo "https://gofund.me/[your-campaign-id]" > ~/gofundme-campaign-2025/CAMPAIGN_URL.txt
```

---

### Step 9: Execute Day 1 Outreach (Oct 2, 12 PM - 6 PM)

**12-2 PM: DM 5 closest contacts**
Use `messaging/dm-templates.md` but **personalize each one**

Example:
"Hey Sarah, I'm reaching out because I'm in a tough spot. You know how I was hospitalized in July with cellulitis? That depleted my savings, and now a contract payment fell through. I need $1,576 by Oct 9 for a lease deposit or I lose my housing.

I know you came to those dinners I cooked at Viva—that work has been meaningful but financially unsustainable. I'm asking if you could donate $25-50 to my GoFundMe, or share it with anyone who might help: [your link]

I hate asking for money, but this is a real crisis. Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks for even reading this,
Byron"

**Goal: $150-250 from first 5 contacts**

**2-5 PM: DM 10 more warm contacts**
- People you cooked for at Viva
- Vitalist Bay connections you met 1-on-1
- 1900 Broadway meetup regulars
- Longevity community members who engaged with your projects

**Goal: $300-500 total by end of Day 1**

**5-6 PM: Post first update**
"Update: Launched 6 hours ago and already at $[amount] thanks to [X] incredible donors. Still need $[remaining] by Oct 9. If you haven't seen the campaign yet: [link]"

---

### Step 10: Daily Execution (Oct 3-9)

Follow your timeline in `tracking/timeline-checklist.md`

**Key milestones:**
- **Day 2 (Oct 3):** LinkedIn post + 2-3 Telegram groups → Target $700-1,000 total
- **Day 3 (Oct 4 - Your Birthday):** Birthday leverage posts → Target $1,100-1,500 total
- **Day 5 (Oct 6):** Mid-campaign assessment → If under $1,200, activate backup plans
- **Day 7 (Oct 8):** Final 24-hour push → All-out effort
- **Day 8 (Oct 9):** Deadline day → Landlord payment or execute Plan B

---

## 🚨 If Campaign Falls Short: Backup Plans

### Plan B: Landlord Negotiation
**If you raise $800-1,500 but not full $2,400:**
- Offer payment plan: $[amount raised] now + $[remainder] by Oct 23
- Show GoFundMe as proof of good faith effort
- Get agreement in writing
- Ask for reduced deposit if possible

### Plan C: Emergency Assistance
**Apply IMMEDIATELY to these programs (don't wait for GoFundMe results):**
- Alameda County ERAP: https://acgov.org/cda/hcd/erap/
- 211 Bay Area: Dial 211 from any phone (free, immediate referrals)
- Catholic Charities: (510) 768-3100
- Bay Area Legal Aid: (800) 551-5554 (tenant rights)

### Plan D: Immediate Income
**Start TODAY (don't wait until Oct 9):**
- DoorDash/Uber Eats: $100-200 possible this weekend
- TaskRabbit: Post gigs today (moving help, furniture assembly, etc.)
- Sell items: Electronics, furniture, anything valuable (OfferUp, Facebook Marketplace)
- Contract work advance: Ask your client for advance payment

### Plan E: Community Housing
**Direct ask to community members:**
- "I need a couch/guest room for 1-2 weeks while I sort out housing. Can you help?"
- Target Viva/Vitalist/1900 Broadway close contacts
- Offer to cook/clean/help in exchange
- Buy time to raise remaining funds

## 📊 Success Metrics - Are You On Track?

**Daily checkpoints:**
- **Day 1 (Oct 2):** $300-500 = ✅ On track | $150-300 = ⚠️ Needs boost | <$150 = 🚨 Activate backups
- **Day 3 (Oct 4):** $1,000+ = ✅ Strong | $600-1,000 = ⚠️ Moderate | <$600 = 🚨 Pivot strategy
- **Day 5 (Oct 6):** $1,600+ = ✅ Likely success | $1,000-1,600 = ⚠️ Close call | <$1,000 = 🚨 Execute Plans B+C
- **Day 7 (Oct 8):** $2,000+ = ✅ Success | $1,500-2,000 = ⚠️ Negotiate | <$1,500 = 🚨 All backup plans

**If behind pace:** Don't panic. You have backup options. Focus on:
1. More personal DMs (highest conversion rate)
2. Video update showing urgency
3. Activate emergency assistance applications
4. Start immediate income activities (DoorDash, selling items)

---

## 💡 Key Strategic Insights

### Why $2,400 is Recommended Over $4,200
**Pros of $2,400:**
- ✅ More achievable in 7 days ($343/day vs $600/day)
- ✅ Clearer crisis narrative (emergency deposit vs future rent)
- ✅ Better conversion psychology (feels attainable to donors)
- ✅ Easier to hit goal and show success (momentum matters)

**When $4,200 makes sense:**
- You have 200+ strong community connections
- Multiple people pledge $100+ before launch
- You can commit to daily outreach (4+ hours/day)
- You have backup plans for November rent if you fall short

### Why "42" Theme is Risky
- ❌ Makes housing crisis seem less serious ("joke during emergency?")
- ❌ Alienates donors unfamiliar with Hitchhiker's Guide
- ❌ Takes focus away from urgency and community connection
- ✅ Better: Mention once at end as fun easter egg for fans

### Why Hospitalization Context is Critical
- ✅ Community already knows (builds credibility)
- ✅ Explains sudden financial crisis (not poor planning)
- ✅ Medical emergencies = high donor empathy
- ✅ Frames past community work as impressive (you kept contributing during recovery)

### Why Past Payment Framing Matters
**❌ Bad:** "I paid $900 at Viva and $2,000 at Vitalist Bay"
- Sounds like asking for reimbursement
- Creates cognitive dissonance ("You had $2,900 but need $2,400?")

**✅ Good:** "I contributed through organizing, cooking, and community building at Viva and Vitalist Bay"
- Frames as service, not expense
- Shows commitment and value provided
- Makes "support me now" feel reciprocal, not transactional

---

## 🎯 What Success Looks Like

### Best Case Scenario
- **Day 1:** 5-10 close friends donate $25-100 each = $400-600
- **Day 3:** LinkedIn + Telegram reach 50-100 people, 10% donate = $300-500
- **Day 5:** Momentum + birthday posts bring secondary network = $400-600
- **Day 7:** Final push + shares reach extended network = $300-500
- **Total: $1,400-2,200** (then negotiate payment plan for gap, or use backup income)

### Realistic Scenario
- Hit $1,500-1,800 by Oct 9
- Negotiate payment plan with landlord ($1,500 now, $900 by Oct 23)
- Use emergency assistance to cover gap
- Start DoorDash/contract work to earn remaining

### Worst Case Scenario
- Raise $600-1,000 (still valuable)
- Combine with emergency assistance ($500-1,000 from ERAP)
- Landlord payment plan
- Temporary housing with community while catching up
- **You still survive, but it's stressful**

### Optimal Outcome
- Hit $2,400+ from GoFundMe alone
- Secure housing by Oct 9
- Use momentum to apply for larger grants (Foresight Fast Grant, FRO)
- Stabilize contract income
- Build emergency fund over next 3 months
- **Transform crisis into launch pad for wealth architecture**
