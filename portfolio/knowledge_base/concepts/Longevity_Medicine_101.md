## What is Longevity Medicine?

**Definition:** Medical field focused on extending healthy human lifespan by targeting biological aging processes rather than treating individual diseases.

**Key Principle:** Aging itself is treatable—not just age-related diseases (cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease).

**Distinction from Traditional Medicine:**
- **Traditional:** Treat diseases as they arise (reactive)
- **Longevity:** Prevent diseases by slowing/reversing aging (proactive)

## Core Technologies & Approaches

### 1. Epigenetic Testing
**What:** Measures biological age (vs chronological age) using DNA methylation patterns

**Key Tests:**
- TruDiagnostic (TruAge)
- GlycanAge
- Elysium Index
- Horvath Clock (academic)

**Use Case:** Track aging rate, measure intervention effectiveness

**Cost:** $300-500 per test
**Frequency:** 2-4x per year recommended

### 2. Senolytics (Cellular Senescence Removal)
**What:** Drugs/supplements that clear "zombie cells" that accumulate with age

**Examples:**
- Dasatinib + Quercetin (D+Q)
- Fisetin
- Navitoclax (experimental)

**Evidence:** Animal studies show lifespan extension, human trials ongoing

**Availability:** Research use, some supplements available

### 3. NAD+ Boosters
**What:** Restore declining NAD+ levels (critical for cellular energy)

**Examples:**
- NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide)
- NR (Nicotinamide Riboside)
- NAD+ IV infusions

**Evidence:** Strong animal data, human studies emerging

**Cost:** $50-200/month (supplements), $500-1000 (IV)

### 4. Metformin & Rapamycin
**What:** FDA-approved drugs repurposed for longevity

**Metformin:**
- Diabetes drug
- Improves metabolic health
- May extend lifespan (TAME trial ongoing)

**Rapamycin:**
- Immunosuppressant
- mTOR inhibitor
- Strong lifespan extension in animals
- Used off-label for longevity (low-dose, pulsed)

### 5. Hormone Optimization
**What:** Restore youthful hormone levels

**Key Hormones:**
- Testosterone (men)
- Estrogen/Progesterone (women)
- Thyroid (T3/T4)
- Growth Hormone

**Delivery:** Bioidentical hormones, peptides

### 6. Stem Cell Therapies
**What:** Regenerate damaged tissues using stem cells

**Types:**
- Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
- Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
- Exosomes

**Status:** Experimental, some clinics offer (regulatory gray area)

## Insurance & Reimbursement

### Current State (2025)
**Most longevity interventions are NOT covered by insurance** (considered preventive, not treatment)

**Exceptions:**
- Metformin (if diabetic or pre-diabetic)
- Hormone replacement (if diagnosed deficiency)
- Some genetic testing (if family history)

**Patient pays out-of-pocket:**
- Epigenetic tests: $300-500
- Physician consults: $200-500/visit
- Supplements: $100-500/month
- IV therapies: $500-1,000/session

### Emerging Coverage
**Medicare:**
- Wellness visits now cover some preventive measures
- Remote patient monitoring (RPM) codes (99453, 99454)
- Chronic care management (if conditions present)

**Private Insurance:**
- Some high-end plans covering epigenetic testing
- Employer wellness programs (partial coverage)
- HSA/FSA eligible (some products)

**Why HealthClock Matters:**
- Helps providers bill for longevity services that ARE covered
- Maximizes reimbursement using existing codes
- Builds case for future longevity-specific CPT codes

---

## Regulatory Landscape

### FDA Position
- Aging is NOT a disease (officially)
- Cannot market "anti-aging" drugs without disease indication
- Most longevity interventions are:
  - Supplements (DSHEA regulation, minimal oversight)
  - Off-label use (legal for physicians to prescribe)
  - Research protocols (IRB-approved)

### Legal Gray Areas
- Stem cell clinics (some shut down by FDA)
- International pharmacies (importing rapamycin, etc.)
- Telemedicine prescribing (state-by-state rules)

### Future Outlook
- **TAME Trial** (Targeting Aging with Metformin) - If succeeds, aging becomes FDA-recognized indication
- **Longevity Escape Velocity** - If therapies prove effective, regulatory pressure to approve
- **International regulatory arbitrage** - Patients traveling for treatments (Dubai, Mexico, Panama)

- Generic billing software doesn't have longevity codes
- Opportunity to be first-mover

### 2. High Patient LTV
- Patients spend $5K-15K/year on longevity
- If insurance covers even 20%, huge impact
- Providers need billing help to capture reimbursement

### 3. Growing Regulatory Support
- Medicare wellness codes expanding
- Remote patient monitoring (RPM) reimbursed
- Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) now covered
- Trend toward preventive care payment

### 4. Network Effects
- Longevity providers all know each other (small community)
- Early adopters become evangelists
- Conference presence = credibility

### 5. Data Advantage
- Claims data + epigenetic test results = unique dataset
- Can show which interventions get reimbursed
- Build AI models to predict claim success
