2. Review `processes/` for step-by-step execution
3. Check `lessons_learned/` to avoid past mistakes

### For Execution:
1. Use `templates/` for consistent documentation
2. Reference `processes/` for checklists
3. Consult `resources/` for external help

### For Decision-Making:
1. Review relevant `concepts/` for framework
2. Check `lessons_learned/` for past decisions
3. Use `processes/` to ensure nothing missed

## Knowledge Capture Workflow

**When you learn something valuable:**

1. **Identify category:**
   - Concept? → `concepts/`
   - Process? → `processes/`
   - Template? → `templates/`
   - Resource? → `resources/`
   - Lesson? → `lessons_learned/`

2. **Create/update file:**
   - Use clear, descriptive filename
   - Follow markdown format
   - Include date and context
   - Add examples where helpful

3. **Link from relevant docs:**
   - Reference in quarterly reviews
   - Link from project documentation
   - Add to OKRs if actionable

4. **Review quarterly:**
   - Update outdated information
   - Archive obsolete content
   - Merge duplicate learnings

---

## File Naming Conventions

## Knowledge Base Principles

### 1. Actionable Over Theoretical
- Every concept should have practical application
- Include examples from actual projects
- Provide step-by-step instructions where possible

### 2. Living Documentation
- Update as you learn (don't wait)
- Mark outdated info clearly
- Version major changes

### 3. Cross-Project Learning
- Extract patterns across HealthClock + BioViz
- Identify what works universally
- Note project-specific exceptions

### 4. Failure Documentation
- Document what didn't work (prevent repetition)
- Explain why it failed (root cause)
- Suggest alternatives (what to try instead)

### 5. External Knowledge Integration
- Capture key insights from books, articles, talks
- Link to original sources
- Summarize in your own words

## Monthly Knowledge Review

**First Friday of each month:**

1. **Capture:** Review month's activities, extract learnings
2. **Categorize:** Sort into concepts/processes/templates/resources/lessons
3. **Document:** Write markdown files for significant learnings
4. **Share:** Update team/advisors on key insights
5. **Apply:** Identify actionable takeaways for next month

**Template for monthly knowledge capture:**
```markdown
# [Month] [Year] Knowledge Capture

## Key Learnings
1. [Learning 1] → Filed in: [category/filename]
2. [Learning 2] → Filed in: [category/filename]

## Process Improvements
- [Process updated]
- [New template created]

## Resources Added
- [Tool/resource discovered]
- [Contact/partnership identified]

## Mistakes to Avoid
- [What went wrong + why]
- [How to prevent next time]
```

---

## Version Control

**Knowledge base can be git-tracked separately:**

```bash
cd /Users/byron/portfolio/knowledge_base
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial knowledge base setup"
```

**Commit frequency:**
- After significant learnings (major events, decisions, milestones)
- End of each month (monthly knowledge review)
- Before sharing with advisors (version for feedback)

**Branch strategy:**
- `main` - Stable, reviewed knowledge
- `drafts` - Work-in-progress learnings
- `archive` - Outdated but retained for history
