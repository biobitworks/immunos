# Benefits Compliance Check Process

**Category:** Process
**Created:** October 2, 2025
**Purpose:** Ensure income/donations don't jeopardize SSDI, CalFresh, Medicare, or Medi-Cal benefits
**Related:** GoFundMe Campaign, HealthClock salary planning

---

## Overview

**When to use this process:**
- Before accepting donations (GoFundMe, gifts)
- Before taking salary/equity (HealthClock, BioViz)
- Before receiving grants (Foresight, Yunes, FRO)
- Quarterly review of income sources

**Why it matters:**
- SSDI provides $1,199/month baseline income
- CalFresh provides food assistance
- Medicare/Medi-Cal provide healthcare coverage
- Losing benefits = major financial crisis

---

## Step 1: Identify Income Type

**Question:** What type of income/funding are you receiving?

### Category A: Personal Gifts/Donations
- GoFundMe for personal emergency
- Birthday gifts from friends/family
- One-time cash gifts

**Impact:** ✅ Generally SAFE for SSDI/Medicare, verify CalFresh

### Category B: Earned Income (Wages/Salary)
- W-2 employment salary
- 1099 contractor payments
- Business profit distributions

**Impact:** ⚠️ SSDI has limits ($1,550/month SGA in 2025), CalFresh counts this

### Category C: Grant Funding
- Research grants (Foresight, Yunes, FRO)
- Philanthropic awards
- Scholarship/fellowship

**Impact:** ✅ Usually SAFE if paid to institution, not individual

### Category D: Investment/Equity
- Stock options (HealthClock equity)
- Capital gains
- Dividend income

**Impact:** ✅ SAFE (not earned income), but counts for SSI (which you don't receive)

---

## Step 2: SSDI Compliance Check

**SSDI = Social Security Disability Insurance**
- Your current benefit: $1,199/month
- Based on work history, not need-based
- More lenient than SSI

### SSDI Rules (2025)

**Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) Limit:**
- **$1,550/month** for non-blind individuals (2025)
- **$2,590/month** for blind individuals (2025)

**What counts toward SGA:**
- ✅ W-2 wages
- ✅ 1099 contractor income
- ✅ Self-employment net profit
- ❌ Gifts/donations (GoFundMe) - DOES NOT COUNT
- ❌ Grants paid to institution - DOES NOT COUNT
- ❌ Investment income (equity gains) - DOES NOT COUNT

### SSDI Work Incentives

**Trial Work Period (TWP):**
- Can earn unlimited amount for 9 months (not necessarily consecutive)
- Each month with earnings >$1,050 (2025) counts toward 9-month limit
- After TWP, SGA limit applies

**Extended Period of Eligibility (EPE):**
- 36 months after TWP ends
- SSDI continues if earnings stay below SGA
- If exceed SGA, benefits stop (but can restart within 36 months)

**Impairment-Related Work Expenses (IRWE):**
- Deduct work expenses related to disability from SGA calculation
- Examples: Medical supplies, assistive technology, transportation
- Example: Earn $2,000/month, but $500 IRWE → $1,500 net (under SGA)

### How to Check SSDI Safety

**For GoFundMe donations:**
1. Verify it's a gift (not payment for services) ✅
2. Personal emergency = gift, not income ✅
3. IRS doesn't tax personal gifts ✅
4. SSA doesn't count gifts toward SGA ✅
5. **SAFE** ✅

**For HealthClock salary:**
1. Determine if W-2 or 1099
2. Calculate monthly gross income
3. Subtract IRWE (if applicable)
4. Compare to $1,550 SGA limit
5. If below → SAFE, if above → Triggers review

**For grant funding:**
1. Check if paid to you personally or institution
2. If institution (Yunes Foundation fiscal sponsor) → NOT counted ✅
3. If personal stipend → Counted toward SGA
4. Yunes $80K/year = $6,667/month → OVER SGA (need structure carefully)

### SSDI Safety Matrix

| Income Type | Monthly Amount | Counted Toward SGA? | SSDI Safe? |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| GoFundMe | $2,500 (one-time) | ❌ No (gift) | ✅ Yes |
| SSDI | $1,199 | N/A (benefit itself) | ✅ Yes |
| Contract work | $500 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (under limit) |
| Yunes salary (personal) | $6,667 | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (over SGA) |
| Yunes (via institution) | $6,667 | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| HealthClock equity | $0 (paper value) | ❌ No (until sold) | ✅ Yes |
| FRO grant (via Yunes) | $10M/3 years | ❌ No (institutional) | ✅ Yes |

**Key Strategy for Byron:**
- Structure Yunes/FRO salary through fiscal sponsor (institution)
- Take stipend, not direct salary
- Avoid W-2 employment over $1,550/month
- Equity in HealthClock is safe (not earned income)

---

## Step 3: CalFresh (Food Stamps) Compliance Check

**CalFresh = California's SNAP program**
- Provides food assistance
- Need-based (income limits apply)

### CalFresh Rules (2025)

**Income Limits (Alameda County):**
- **Gross income:** <200% FPL = $2,510/month (1 person household)
- **Net income:** <100% FPL = $1,255/month (after deductions)

**What counts as income:**
- ✅ SSDI ($1,199)
- ✅ Wages/salary (W-2, 1099)
- ✅ Self-employment net profit
- ❌ One-time lump sums (GoFundMe) if spent within month
- ❌ Gifts (if irregular and infrequent)
- ❌ Grants for education/research (if institutional)

### Current CalFresh Calculation (Byron)

**Monthly Income:**
- SSDI: $1,199
- Contract work: $250 (variable)
- **Total: $1,449/month**

**Gross Income Limit:** $2,510
**Cushion:** $2,510 - $1,449 = **$1,061 under limit** ✅

### CalFresh Safety for GoFundMe

**Question:** Does $2,500 GoFundMe count as income?

**Answer:** ⚠️ MAYBE (gray area)

**USDA/FNS Guidelines:**
- One-time gifts/donations: NOT counted if irregular and infrequent
- Crowdfunding for personal emergency: Generally treated as gift
- BUT: If deposit in bank, may trigger recertification question

**Best Practice:**
1. Spend GoFundMe funds immediately (Oct 9 - pay Jerry, buy computer)
2. Don't let it sit in bank account for months
3. If CalFresh asks, explain: "One-time emergency gift for housing crisis"
4. Provide GoFundMe campaign link as proof of emergency nature

**Worst Case:**
- CalFresh counts $2,500 as October income
- October gross income: $1,199 + $250 + $2,500 = $3,949 (OVER limit)
- CalFresh suspended for October only
- November: Back to $1,449 (under limit), reinstate

**Likelihood:** Low (CalFresh rarely counts emergency crowdfunding as income)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Frame as "emergency gift" not "income"
- Spend within month (don't hoard)
- Report honestly if asked during recertification

### CalFresh Safety Matrix

| Scenario | Gross Monthly Income | Under $2,510 Limit? | CalFresh Safe? |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Current (SSDI + contract) | $1,449 | ✅ Yes ($1,061 cushion) | ✅ Yes |
| + GoFundMe (if counted) | $3,949 | ❌ No | ❌ No (1 month only) |
| + HealthClock $500/mo | $1,949 | ✅ Yes ($561 cushion) | ✅ Yes |
| + Yunes $6,667/mo | $8,116 | ❌ No | ❌ No (ineligible) |

**Key Strategy for Byron:**
- Keep monthly income <$2,510 (maintain CalFresh)
- If Yunes approved, structure as institutional grant (not personal income)
- If HealthClock salary, keep <$1,000/month (within cushion)

---

## Step 4: Medicare & Medi-Cal Compliance Check

### Medicare (Federal)
**Rules:** No income or asset limits
**SSDI recipients automatically qualify**

**Impact of income:**
- ❌ NONE - Medicare doesn't care about income
- ✅ GoFundMe: SAFE
- ✅ Salary: SAFE
- ✅ Grants: SAFE
- ✅ Equity: SAFE

**Part B Premium (2025):**
- Standard: $174.70/month
- High earners (MAGI >$106,000): Higher premiums (IRMAA)
- Byron's income: Well below threshold → standard premium ✅

### Medi-Cal (California Medicaid)
**Rules:** No asset test through 2025 (ACA expansion)
**Income limit:** 138% FPL = $1,732/month (1 person)

**Current Status (Byron):**
- Likely enrolled as SSDI + low income
- SSDI $1,199 < $1,732 limit ✅

**Impact of income increases:**
- If income >138% FPL ($1,732/month) → May lose Medi-Cal
- If lose Medi-Cal → Medicare still active (SSDI qualifier)
- Byron has Medicare Part A+B → Already covered

**CalFresh vs Medi-Cal Income Limits:**
- CalFresh: $2,510/month (200% FPL)
- Medi-Cal: $1,732/month (138% FPL)
- **Medi-Cal is tighter limit**

**Safety Matrix:**

| Income Level | CalFresh Eligible? | Medi-Cal Eligible? |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| $1,449 (current) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| $1,949 (+ $500 HealthClock) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (over $1,732) |
| $8,116 (+ Yunes) | ❌ No | ❌ No |

**Key Insight:**
- Medi-Cal more restrictive than CalFresh
- If take salary >$533/month (beyond SSDI) → May lose Medi-Cal
- Medicare still active (SSDI-based, not income-based)
- Loss of Medi-Cal = Loss of supplemental coverage (not catastrophic, but costs increase)

---

## Step 5: SSI vs SSDI Clarification

**SSI = Supplemental Security Income (need-based)**
**SSDI = Social Security Disability Insurance (work history-based)**

### Byron's Status: SSDI Only (Not SSI)

**Why?**
- SSDI $1,199/month > SSI max $967/month (2025)
- SSI requires income <$967/month
- Byron's SSDI already exceeds SSI limit → Ineligible

**Good News:**
- SSI has $2,000 asset limit (GoFundMe would count)
- SSDI has NO asset limit (can save, invest, own equity)
- ✅ Byron can save GoFundMe funds, own HealthClock equity, no problem

**What if SSDI stopped?**
- Could apply for SSI
- But SSI + assets >$2,000 = ineligible
- Better to keep SSDI (higher benefit, no asset limit)

---

## Step 6: IRS Tax Implications

**Not a benefit, but important for financial planning**

### GoFundMe Tax Rules

**IRS Position:**
- Personal emergency gifts = NOT taxable income
- Crowdfunding for business = Taxable income
- Gift tax: $18,000/year per person (giver pays, not recipient)

**Byron's GoFundMe:**
- Personal housing emergency ✅
- NOT business fundraising ✅
- Gifts from individuals ✅
- **NO income tax owed** ✅

**Form 1099-K Trigger:**
- GoFundMe issues 1099-K if >$5,000 raised
- Byron raising $2,500 → No 1099-K
- Even if 1099-K issued, can report as "non-taxable gift" on tax return

### Grant Funding Tax Rules

**Foresight Fast Grant ($10K):**
- If paid to Byron personally → 1099-MISC (taxable)
- If paid to institution (Yunes fiscal sponsor) → Not taxable to Byron
- **Structure matters**

**Yunes Foundation Salary ($80K):**
- If W-2 → Taxable income (standard payroll taxes)
- If stipend via institution → May be tax-exempt (research fellowship)
- Consult tax attorney for structure

### HealthClock Equity Tax Rules

**Stock options:**
- Grant = No tax (paper value only)
- Exercise = Taxable event (AMT risk if ISOs)
- Sale = Capital gains tax (long-term if hold >1 year)

**Byron's HealthClock equity:**
- Founder shares (not options) → No tax until sold
- If sold for $1M+ → Capital gains tax (15-20% federal + 13.3% CA)
- If held <1 year → Short-term gains (ordinary income rates)

---

## Step 7: Documentation & Record Keeping

### What to Track

**For SSDI Work Incentives:**
- Monthly earnings (W-2, 1099, self-employment)
- IRWE expenses (medical, assistive tech)
- Trial Work Period months used (max 9)

**For CalFresh:**
- All income sources (SSDI, wages, gifts)
- Bank statements (prove one-time gifts spent)
- Recertification notices (usually every 12 months)

**For IRS:**
- GoFundMe campaign documentation (prove personal emergency)
- Grant award letters (prove institutional vs personal)
- Form 1099-K (if issued)

### Where to Store

**Digital:**
- `/Users/byron/portfolio/financial_models/Benefits_Tracking.xlsx`
- Scan award letters, bank statements, CalFresh notices
- Google Drive backup (encrypted)

**Physical:**
- File folder: "Benefits & Income Documentation"
- Keep 7 years (IRS audit period)

---

## Step 8: Quarterly Review Checklist

**Every 3 months (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct):**

- [ ] Calculate total monthly income (average last 3 months)
- [ ] Compare to SSDI SGA limit ($1,550/month)
- [ ] Compare to CalFresh gross limit ($2,510/month)
- [ ] Compare to Medi-Cal limit ($1,732/month)
- [ ] Update income tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] Check for benefit notices (SSDI, CalFresh, Medi-Cal)
- [ ] Adjust income sources if approaching limits
- [ ] Consult benefits attorney if major changes planned

**Red Flags:**
- Monthly income >$1,400 (getting close to Medi-Cal limit)
- Monthly income >$2,300 (getting close to CalFresh limit)
- Large one-time payment (GoFundMe, grant, stock sale)
- New income source (job, contract, equity sale)

---

## Step 10: Scenario Planning

### Scenario A: GoFundMe Success ($2,500 raised)

**SSDI Impact:**
- Gift, not income ✅
- SAFE ✅

**CalFresh Impact:**
- Spend within October (pay Jerry, buy computer) ✅
- Unlikely to be counted ✅
- Even if counted → 1 month suspension (not permanent)

**Action:** Proceed with GoFundMe, spend immediately

---

### Scenario B: HealthClock Seed Round (Take $80K/year salary)

**SSDI Impact:**
- $80K/year = $6,667/month
- WAY over SGA limit ($1,550)
- Would lose SSDI ❌

**Mitigation:**
- Don't take salary, take equity only
- If must take salary, structure as:
  - Part-time contractor <$1,550/month, OR
  - Unpaid founder + equity vesting, OR
  - Salary deferred until company exit

**Best Option:** Equity-only until exit (no salary risk)

---

### Scenario C: Yunes Foundation Salary ($80K, 12 months)

**SSDI Impact:**
- $6,667/month direct salary → Over SGA → Lose SSDI ❌

**Structure Options:**

**Option 1: Institutional Grant (BEST)**
- Yunes pays for Byron's time as "research fellow"
- Grant to Yunes Foundation, Byron is subcontractor
- Framed as grant, not employment income
- SSA may not count (verify with WIPA specialist)

**Option 2: Stipend (OK)**
- Education/research stipend
- Not W-2 employment
- May not count toward SGA (case-by-case)

**Option 3: Direct Salary (WORST)**
- W-2 from Yunes
- Counts toward SGA
- Lose SSDI immediately

**Recommendation:** Negotiate with Jeff at Yunes for institutional grant structure (Option 1)

---

### Scenario D: FRO Awarded ($10M, Byron is PI)

**SSDI Impact:**
- If salary is institutional (via Yunes fiscal sponsor) ✅ SAFE
- If direct salary from FRO ❌ NOT SAFE

**Structure:**
- FRO → Convergent Research → Yunes Foundation (fiscal sponsor) → Byron (research fellow)
- Not direct employment, institutional research position
- Similar to NIH postdoc (usually SSDI-safe)

**Action:** Include in FRO budget proposal: "PI salary via institutional fiscal sponsor"

---

## Final Checklist: Before Accepting Any Income

- [ ] Identify income type (gift, wage, grant, equity)
- [ ] Calculate monthly amount
- [ ] Check SSDI SGA limit ($1,550/month)
- [ ] Check CalFresh limit ($2,510/month gross)
- [ ] Check Medi-Cal limit ($1,732/month)
- [ ] Verify tax treatment (1099-K, W-2, gift)
- [ ] Structure to minimize benefit impact (institutional vs personal)
- [ ] Consult WIPA specialist if unsure (free service)
- [ ] Document everything (award letters, bank statements)
- [ ] Review quarterly (adjust if approaching limits)

---

**Key Takeaway:** Most income sources can be structured to preserve SSDI/CalFresh/Medi-Cal if planned carefully. Institutional grants (Yunes, FRO) are safest. Direct salary >$1,550/month triggers SSDI review. Always verify BEFORE accepting new income.
