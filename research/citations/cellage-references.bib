  abstract = {Cellular senescence is a permanent growth arrest that acts as a barrier against
             cancer development. We describe a genetic screening approach to identify genes that
             bypass cellular senescence. Using retroviral cDNA libraries, we identified BCL6 as
             a potent inhibitor of senescence. BCL6 efficiently immortalizes primary mouse
             fibroblasts and cooperates with RAS in transformation. BCL6 operates downstream of
             p53 through cyclin D1 induction. These results demonstrate that BCL6 contributes
             to cancer development by rendering cells unresponsive to antiproliferative signals
             from the p19(ARF)-p53 pathway.},
