## 🔬 Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Phase 1)
1. **Can picosecond ultrasonic imaging resolve ECM at <100nm in live cells?**
   - Status: To be tested in Fast Grant
   - Hypothesis: Yes, based on materials science precedent

2. **How does naked mole rat ECM differ from mouse/human?**
   - Status: Literature review in progress
   - Hypothesis: Less crosslinking, maintained compliance with age

3. **When does ECM aging begin - before or after functional decline?**
   - Status: Unanswered - key question for biomarkers
   - Hypothesis: ECM changes precede functional changes

### Secondary Questions (Phase 2-3)
4. Can we detect ECM changes in response to interventions (senolytics, etc.)?
5. What are the early biomarkers of ECM aging?
6. Do ECM aging signatures predict healthspan?

## 🧪 Research Notes

### Conceptual Notes
- [[05_Research_Notes/01_ECM_Research|ECM Research Folder]]
- ECM structure and organization
- ECM-cell interactions
- Mechanotransduction pathways

### Hypotheses
- ECM stiffening is causal in aging (not just correlation)
- Naked mole rats avoid ECM crosslinking
- Picosecond ultrasonics can measure stiffness gradient around single cells

### Ideas & Observations
- Need to compare ECM in different tissues
- Time-series imaging more valuable than single timepoints
- AI can potentially predict ECM age from images

## 🎯 Experiments (Planned)

### Phase 1 Experiments (Fast Grant)
1. **Calibration on standard materials**
   - Silicon, PDMS hydrogels
   - Verify resolution and sensitivity

2. **First naked mole rat cell images**
   - Compare to mouse fibroblasts
   - Document ECM structure

3. **Time-series imaging**
   - 24-48 hour live cell tracking
   - ECM remodeling dynamics

4. **Intervention testing (proof-of-concept)**
   - Oxidative stress (H2O2)
   - Senescence induction
   - Test reversibility

### Future Experiments (Phase 2+)

## 🎓 Knowledge Gaps

### What We Don't Know
1. Exactly when ECM aging begins
2. Which ECM changes are causal vs. consequential
3. Whether ECM aging is reversible
4. Optimal interventions for ECM health
5. How to measure ECM aging non-destructively in humans

### Why This Matters
- Can't develop therapies without understanding mechanisms
- Need biomarkers for intervention trials
- Current methods inadequate for longitudinal studies

## 📝 Notes & Ideas

### Emerging Themes
- ECM is understudied relative to its importance (30-50% body mass)
- Label-free imaging is critical for native mechanics
- Naked mole rats are ideal model for aging-resistant ECM
- AI can accelerate ECM analysis

### Future Directions
- Multi-omics integration (ECM proteins + mechanics + cell behavior)
- Clinical translation (skin ECM as aging biomarker)
- Therapeutic targeting (crosslink breakers, MMP modulators)
