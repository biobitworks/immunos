## 📄 Abstract
Abstract
            
              There is a consensus about the strong correlation between the elasticity of cells and tissue and their normal, dysplastic, and cancerous states. However, developments in cell mechanics have not seen significant progress in clinical applications. In this work, we explore the possibility of using phonon acoustics for this purpose. We used phonon microscopy to obtain a measure of the elastic properties between cancerous and normal breast cells. Utilising the raw time-resolved phonon-derived data (300 k individual inputs), we employed a deep learning technique to differentiate between MDA-MB-231 and MCF10a cell lines. We achieved a 93% accuracy using a single phonon measurement in a volume of approximately 2.5 μm

              . We also investigated means for classification based on a physical model that suggest the presence of unidentified mechanical markers. We have successfully created a compact sensor design as a proof of principle, demonstrating its compatibility for use with needles and endoscopes, opening up exciting possibilities for future applications.
