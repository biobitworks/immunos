Abstract
The ability of animal cells to sense, adhere to and remodel their local extracellular matrix (ECM) is central to control of cell shape, mechanical responsiveness, motility and signalling and hence to development, tissue formation, wound healing and the immune response. Cell-ECM interactions occur at a variety of specialised, multi-protein adhesion complexes that serve to physically link the ECM, predominantly via clustered transmembrane receptors of the integrin family, to the cytoskeleton and the intracellular signalling apparatus. Here we review how the interplay of mechanical forces, biochemical signalling, and molecular self-organisation determines the composition, organisation, mechanosensitivity and dynamics of adhesions. Progress in the identification of core common interactome modules and characterisation of rearrangements in response to force, together with advanced imaging approaches, has improved understanding of adhesion maturation and turnover and the relationships between adhesion structures and functions. Perturbations of adhesion contribute to a broad range of disease and to age-related dysfunction, thus an improved understanding may facilitate therapeutic intervention in these conditions.
Introduction
Cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions play integral roles in developmental morphogenesis and physiological functions. In metazoans, the ECM serves as an active biomaterial scaffold, spanning multiple orders of magnitude of length scale1. Cells invivo interact extensively and dynamically with the ECM, actively contributing to both ECM biogenesis and remodelling, while themselves being profoundly influenced by the ECM physicochemical properties. The sensitivity of cells to cues presented by diverse ECM scaffolds underlies a broad array of cell-type specific responses ranging from motility to

metabolism and survival2–5. The cell-ECM interaction is intrinsically mechanical; cells generate forces which drive coordinated shape changes during cell locomotion and which remodel and mechanically alter the ECM. Cells also mechanochemically interrogate their ECM microenvironment, with specific ECM adhesions and local ECM deformations registered and transduced into biochemical signals that propagate downstream along various complex pathways. The multifaceted involvement of cell-ECM adhesion-dependent mechanobiology in many aspects of cellular physiology is becoming well recognised4,6,7. Proper mechanosensitivity and mechanoresponsiveness of cell-ECM interactions are essential for normal physiology and their dysfunctions can be pivotal in a range of pathological conditions, including aging, inflammation, and cancer4,6–8.
Since its identification in the 1960–70s, a combination of biochemical, biophysical and cell culture models have provided extensive information on the structures and interactions of the molecules involved in cell-ECM adhesion, their organisation into ordered multi-protein complexes and their interface with signalling and cytoskeletal networks9,10. This, together with genetic analyses in model organisms, has helped build a detailed picture of the roles and mechanisms of action of cell adhesions and the central roles that the integrin family of transmembrane heterodimeric adhesion receptors play11. Integrins directly engage ECM proteins and connect to the cytoskeletal scaffold via various intermediary adaptor proteins, providing access points for combinatorial regulation and control. Several types of micronscale multi-protein complexes that mediate cell-ECM adhesion are recognised [Box 1], typically linking ECM-bound integrins to the actin cytoskeleton or intermediate filaments via distinct configurations of myriad adaptor and signalling proteins. Importantly, these connections between adhesion complexes and the actomyosin contractility apparatus are dynamic and mechanosensitive, actively controlling cell shape and the force generation that propels adherent cell migration. Advanced biochemical and biophysical tools [Box 2] are revealing the structural and mechanical organisation of core cell-ECM adhesion complexes and how dynamic association of regulatory and signalling components connect cell-ECM adhesion to virtually all other cellular signalling circuits12. The vast literature precludes a comprehensive review of all aspects of cell-ECM adhesion and we refer readers to recent detailed reviews on integrin mechanosensing, ECM, cell migration and integrins in disease2,3,6–9,11,13. Here we focus on the dynamic multi-protein assemblies through which integrins mediate cell-ECM interactions and interface with the cytoskeleton. We seek to provide a current view of the molecular composition and organisation of integrin-mediated adhesions and how their dynamics is influenced by mechanical and signalling activities. We do not review adhesions in 3D matrix, as these have recently been reviewed elsewhere14, instead we largely limit our discussion to the abundant data from high-resolution experimental systems where cells adhere to defined planar artificial substrates, as this facilitates detailed reductionist biochemical, biophysical and imaging approaches.
Molecular composition of adhesions
Dynamic cell adhesion to ECM substrates is largely mediated by micron-scale clusters of integrins with associated signalling, scaffolding and cytoskeletal proteins. These integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) can be classified based on their size, composition, organisation,

lifetime, localisation and function (Box 1). As depicted in Fig 1a and b, and discussed in more detail in later sections, adhesions form when nanoclusters of activated integrins engage the ECM and associate with cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, such as talin, linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. Rho-mediated activation of myosin contractility drives adhesion maturation through talin-mediated engagement of the actin filaments undergoing retrograde flow leading to mechanical activation of talin, recruitment of additional adaptor and signalling proteins, and stabilisation of active integrin. This maturation and remodelling of IACs is strongly influenced by factors such as cell type, contractility and the composition and rigidity of the ECM substrate. New adhesion formation, adhesion maturation and subsequent adhesion turnover, driven by disassembly in response to loss of tension or the internalisation of integrins through endocytosis, enables the cell to sense and respond to changes in the local extracellular mechanical environment and permits intracellular signals to control adhesion dynamics that enable cell migration and influence ECM organisation. A detailed mechanistic understanding of IAC assembly, dynamics and function requires identification of the proteins present in these multi-protein assemblies and elucidation of their key interaction networks. Here we briefly summarise current information on the integrin family and discuss recent advances through mass spectrometry-based identification of integrin-associated proteins.
Integrin adhesion receptors.
By engaging ECM components with their extracellular domains and cytoskeletal and signalling proteins via their cytoplasmic tails, integrins provide a transmembrane link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton, transmitting chemical and mechanical signals into and out of the cell11. Integrins are conserved throughout metazoans11, and loss of function experiments in a range of model organisms (including mice, zebrafish, Drosophila, C. elegans and Xenopus) establishes essential roles for integrins in cell adhesion and tissue integrity15–19. Functional integrin receptors are obligate heterodimers of an α-subunit and β-subunit that are mostly unrelated to one another in sequence but are both type I transmembrane proteins with large multidomain extracellular portions, a single-pass transmembrane region and a generally short cytoplasmic tail11 (Fig 1c). The number of different α- and β-subunits per species appears to increase with organismal complexity, with mammals having 18 α-subunits and 8 β-subunits that can combine into 24 distinct αβ heterodimers11. Each heterodimer exhibits distinct, but sometimes overlapping, specificity for ECM ligands, such as collagens, laminins, fibronectin and vitronectin, allowing the precise repertoire of integrins expressed on the cell surface to determine the cellular response to complex ECMs.
Integrins are well understood at the structural and functional level, and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere9–11,20. In the early 2000s, crystallography first revealed the domain architecture of integrin extracellular domains and with electron microscopy (EM) provided insights into conformational regulation of integrins (reviewed in10,21,22) (Fig. 1c). In most integrins, interactions between the β-propeller in the α-subunit and the βA domain in the β-subunit form the ligand binding “head” of the heterodimer, this head is connected to the transmembrane domains and the cytoplasmic tails via α- and β-subunit “legs”. The structures of the extracellular portions of many integrin heterodimers have now been

resolved by x-ray crystallography and a notable feature is that the ligand-binding headpiece folds back against the α and β subunit legs resulting in a bent structure (Fig. 1c). While the extent of bending may vary between different heterodimers, bent structures can be seen in cryo-EM images of purified integrins23–26 and most recently bent αIIbβ3 integrins have been visualised in cryo-electron tomograms of membrane protrusions in platelets27. It is now generally accepted that in the bent conformation integrins exhibit low affinity for extracellular ligands and the legs, trans-membrane domains and cytoplasmic tails of the α- and β-subunits are close to one another11,21,22. Additional EM, cryo-EM, superresolution microscopy (SRM) imaging, biophysical studies, mutational analyses and x-ray crystallography of smaller portions of integrin, support the idea that integrins adopt at least two additional conformations; an extended-closed conformation that also has low affinity for ligand, and a high-affinity extended-open conformation where the head piece is open coupling conformational change in the ligand-binding head with separation of the subunit legs, transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions11,21–26,28 (Fig. 1c). Integrin affinity for ECM, and hence integrin-mediated adhesions, are thus influenced by the dynamic equilibrium between the bent closed, extended closed and extended open integrin conformations29–32 (Fig. 1d). These equilibria are altered by the binding of proteins to the short cytoplasmic tails of integrins and through mechanical forces applied to integrins via actomyosin-mediated contractility, extracellular fluid flow and ECM tension6,11,20. Thus, the low-affinity bent state is often supported by the association of inhibitory proteins with the α- or β-subunit cytoplasmic tails, stabilising the association of α and β tails and inhibiting the binding of activating proteins, while binding of the FERM domain at the N-terminus of the cytoskeletal adaptor protein talin (Box 3) to the β-subunit cytoplasmic tail destabilises the association between the α- and β-subunits, favouring high-affinity extended integrin conformations33–35. As talin also contains binding sites for F-actin and other IAC proteins, including vinculin33 (Box 3), it can link active integrins to the actin cytoskeleton allowing force transmission, and help pattern and organise protein networks at IACs (Fig. 1c). This multi-step process, by which intracellular signals increase integrin affinity for ligands is termed activation, or inside-out signalling, and kindlin (Box 3) binding to integrin β tails also contributes, although the molecular mechanisms are less clearly defined20,33. Notably, using well-characterised conformation-specific Fabs to stabilize α4β1 and α5β1 integrins into ensembles of defined conformational states, recent detailed analysis of integrin-binding kinetics31 has revealed that low-affinity integrin conformations (both the bent closed and extended closed) bind ligand more rapidly than high-affinity extended open conformations but that the extended open states have much lower off-rates (Fig. 1d). The increased on-rate, together with a higher fraction of low-affinity integrins on the cell surface leads the authors to suggest that integrin binding will occur in the low affinity form, prior to inside-out activation, but that ligand binding and activation would rapidly lead to conversion to the high-affinity extended open form that permits coupling to the actin cytoskeleton supporting cell adhesion and the recruitment of additional intracellular binding partners that mechanically reinforce the link and allow subsequent downstream signal transduction.
The integrin adhesome.
The proteins associated with IACs (extracellular, membrane bound and cytoplasmic) are collectively termed the integrin adhesome. IACs were originally characterised using

microscopy and many constituents, including talin, vinculin and integrin, were identified by immunofluorescence, through expression of fluorescently-tagged proteins, biochemical interactions and yeast 2-hybrid screens36. Building on this, the adhesome was initially predicted from sequence similarities with known IAC-associated proteins, the presence of specific predicted domains, and extensive literature analysis37,38 (Fig. 2a). However, mass spectrometry proteomics of purified IACs has now expanded the number of integrin adhesome proteins to several thousands36,39,40(Fig. 2b). Profiling the adhesome of different cells, or on different matrices, has allowed comparison of cell-type or integrin specific factors and has facilitated investigation of phosphorylation of adhesome components41–44. Different adhesions can also be compared with this method. Indeed, despite the requirement for purification of protein complexes from cell populations, which may result in mixing different types of adhesion, proteomic analyses identified a new class of β5 integrinenriched adhesion, the reticular adhesion45 (Box 1). Detailed bioinformatic analysis of adhesomes from various cell types, under differing mechanical and signalling conditions, has revealed a consensus adhesome of only around 60 proteins12,40,46 (Supplementary Table 1). Comparison of these components with the literature curated list, suggests that they are enriched in core structural IAC proteins, perhaps because these are most easily purified in the complex. The complexity of the adhesome prevents us from providing detailed descriptions of each component but four canonical interrelated signalling/cytoskeletal modules have been identified in the consensus adhesome12,40,46 (Fig 2d).
While proteomic identification of adhesome proteins complements more focused functional studies on individual components, it does not by itself provide protein-protein interaction data. Therefore, several groups initiated BioID proximity-dependent labelling approaches, allowing mass spectrometric identification of proteins within 15–25 nm of specific bait proteins – IAC proteins fused to a biotin ligase47–50 (Fig. 2c). This approach, which has been applied to both focal adhesions (FA) and hemidesmosomes (Box 1), avoids the requirement to purify IACs for analysis, removing the need for reversible chemical crosslinking and presumably facilitating identification of weaker, more transient interactions beyond the core structural components47–52. Furthermore, separately labelling several different IAC proteins allows multiplexing analysis facilitating generation of proximity maps that are more likely to reveal molecular interactions and help map protein localisations and interactions in sub-regions of adhesions. Initial studies focused on a few IAC bait proteins, notably paxillin, kindlin-2 and talin-1, but multiplexed data from 16 IAC baits spanning all 4 canonical adhesome modules (Fig 2d) have now been reported50. Hierarchical clustering of bait proteins based on their interactions led to 5 clusters of baits that aligns relatively well with the canonical modules defined by proteomic analysis of purified IACs. Thus, in vivo proximity labelling generally supports models derived from proteomics of purified IACs (Supplementary Table 1), however additional factors not captured in the purified adhesomes were observed. Notably, KANK2 was identified as paxillin- and kindlin-proximal in initial studies47 and this was strongly supported in later larger studies where KANK2, and other members of the cortical microtubule stabilising complex (CMSC), were robustly identified with many IAC bait proteins50. Focused studies have confirmed the importance of KANKs (Box 3) in IACs43,53–55. The integration of advanced imaging studies (discussed below) with new proximity interaction data on IAC components, should contribute to a clearer picture

of the molecular organisation of adhesions during assembly, maturation and turnover (Fig 1a,b).
Molecular organisation of adhesions
Advances in our understanding of the structural organisation of cell-ECM adhesions owe much to improved biophysical and bioimaging methods. Resolving individual IAC structures revealed the presence of nanoscale compartments, termed nanoclusters here, which may comprise the structural and functional modules of IACs.
Nanocluster subunits of adhesions.
Although the presence of sub-diffraction-limited IAC structures such as nascent adhesions [Box 1] have long been appreciated56, the development of SRM in mid-2000s57, enabled investigation of the nanoscale internal organisation of IACs (Box 2). Various SRM techniques all revealed extensive structural granularity in FA, typically characterised by ‘nanoclusters’, nodules of high local IAC protein density, embedded within lower density regions58–61. As discussed below, nanocluster organisation appears to originate with initial adhesion formation, triggered by integrin activation (Fig. 1b). Using conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies, active and inactive integrin α5β1 are found to segregate into distinct nanoclusters (Fig. 3b), suggestive of cooperativity within nanoclusters and implying that nanoclusters could be functionally regulated as distinct substructures61.
Multiple factors serve as gatekeepers for the maturation of IAC from the initial nanocluster or nascent adhesion stage (Fig. 1b). The molecular chronology of initial IAC organization in the protruding lamellipodia of migrating cells62 has been probed by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (Box 2), which identified kindlin-2 as the earliest IAC component recruited, followed closely by talin in a myosin II-dependent fashion. Transient α5β1 and α-actinin-containing complexes was also identified as precursors to the formation of nascent adhesion. The integration of advanced imaging with ECM nanopatterning offers opportunities to systematically dissect the influence of ligand geometry, mobility and stoichiometry, and of mechanical force. The nanoscale geometric requirement for IAC formation was first probed by micelle-based nanoparticle patterning, which revealed that a variety of cell types adhered and robustly formed IAC on substrates with ligand spacing in the ~60 nm range more effectively than on ~110 nm ligand spacing63,64. This was followed by studies combining supported lipid bilayers presenting mobile RGD ligands with nano-patterned mobility barriers or ligand-decorated pedestals65, which enabled the contribution of ligand mobility and ligand immobilization to be distinguished. In fibroblasts, the assembly of IAC nanoclusters involves the initial clustering of mobile RGD ligands, actin polymizeration, and the early recruitment of FAK, paxillin, and talin (Fig. 1b, Box 3), in conjunction with Src-dependent cell spreading65,66. On a uniform supported bilayer, these initial IAC nanoclusters are mobile but unable to promote further adhesion maturation, presumably due to the inability of the supported bilayer to support high force. In contrast, on nanopatterned supported lipid bilayers, the rigid mobility barrier serves to immobilize the IAC nanoclusters allowing force transmission, thus enabling IAC maturation, contractility, and further cell spreading. Nanocluster maturation also appears to orchestrate

a local remodelling of the plasma membrane, as characterised by fluorescence anisotropy of GPI-anchored proteins67. Initial integrin nanoclusters are associated with disordered lipid domains, but significant lipid order, sometimes called membrane rafts68, is observed upon integrin immobilisation, activation of actomyosin contractility via FAK/Src/ROCK signalling, and the recruitment of activated vinculin (Fig. 1b)67. Importantly, using SRMbased molecule counting, the molecular stoichiometry of IAC nanoclusters formed on either supported bilayer or ECM-coated substrate were determined to be largely comparable, containing ~50 molecules of integrin αvβ3 within ~100 nm puncta69. Since lateral interaction of integrins with membrane proteins such as syndecan70, tetraspanin71,72, and growth factor receptors73 have long been known to influence integrin-dependent signaling, often in association with specialized lipid domains such as membrane rafts74 or tetraspanin microdomains75, revisiting and redefining their structure and dynamics with the latest imaging and molecular manipulation tools will likely become a fruitful avenue for future investigation.
Since major components of ECM are high molecular-weight fibrous glycoproteins, ECM ligand presentation invivois expected to be hetergeneous at the nanoscale. The configuration of ECM fibres of various geometry has recently been recapitulated by patterning RGD-ligands with <30 nm spatial features, comparable to the binding footprint of single integrin molecules76. This experimental platform revealed that robust IAC nanocluster formation requires 2-dimensional ligand presentation, either as parallel or crossing lines, over the range of >40 nm, as opposed to linear single fiber (1-D). Additionally, it was also shown that while conformational activation of integrin is necessary for nanocluster nucleation, conformationally-activated, ligand-binding defective, integrin αvβ3 mutants are recruited into preformed clusters, suggesting capture of exposed integrin β cytoplasmic tails by adaptor proteins such as talin76. Indeed, it has long been known that inactive integrins or even isolated integrin β tails fused to unrelated transmembrane and extracellular domains can be recruited to adhesions and that this depends on interactions of the β tail with adaptors77. Among such adaptors, talin, with an elongated dimension of >60–80 nm and the potential to dimerize, is proposed to determine to dimension of the nanocluster and sensitivity to ligand presentation geometry as discussed further below78.
Molecular architecture of adhesions.
Our current understanding of the 3D molecular architecture of IACs is based primarily on studies of FA or podosomes. Immuno-Electron Microscopy79, Atomic Force Microscopy80, and Cryo-Electron Tomography81 have defined the thin (<200 nm) sub-diffractive vertical (z) dimensionality of FA and identified a limited number of IAC protein complexes. However, systematic 3D-mapping of protein organisation in IACs is significantly accelerated by SRM methods such as iPALM57,59,82,83(Box 2). These studies showed that IAC proteins exhibit characteristic vertical (z-axis) density distribution, indicative of organisation into partially overlapping layers relative to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3c)59. Relative to the fibronectin-coated substrate surface (z = 0 nm), the integrin cytoplasmic tail was found to locate at z~30 nm, consistent with the extended open conformation28,59. The ~20 nm band centering around the integrin cytoplasmic tails has been termed the integrin signalling layer (ISL), within which the peak density of ILK, FAK, kindlin-2, and paxillin are

located59,84–88. The intermediate layer, immediately adjacent to the ISL, is termed Force Transduction Layer (FTL) primarily due to the presence of key mechanotransducer proteins such as talin and vinculin. Above the FTL, the actin regulatory layer (ARL) corresponds to the interfacial zone where stress fibers are coupled to FAs, with high densities of F-actin and actin binding proteins such as VASP and α-actinin. To date, 3D nanoscale protein mapping has been reported for IACs from cell lines of epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblast origins as well as pluripotent stem cells59,82,84,85,87,89. Additionally, in podosomes, talin, vinculin, and paxillin localise to comparable positions as in FA (Fig. 3d–e)90. In general, the multilayer hierarchy of IAC organisation is broadly similar in all these studies, albeit with notable variations in the absolute z-position of the layers (likely due to varying ECM thickness in different experimental settings84) and, as discussed further below, in FTL proteins such as vinculin. Importantly, SRM-based protein mapping results are in remarkable agreement with the BioID proximity-dependent labelling results described above47,50 (Fig. 3f), suggesting that the multilayer stratification captures a broad structural framework underlying IAC molecular architecture.
What controls the molecular architecture of IACs? Thus far, talin is the most notable determinant of structural FA organisation. SRM imaging of talin with fluorophores at the N- or C-terminus, showed it to adopt a highly polarised orientation (Fig. 3c, 4b) with the integrin-binding N-terminus in ISL and actin-binding C-terminus in ARL, separated by 20–30 nm along the z-axis perpendicular to the plasma membrane58,59. When endogenous talin is substituted by engineered talin of altered lengths (by deletion or insertion of central rod domains), the N-terminus remains anchored in the ISL but the z-positions of the C-terminus and ARL proteins such as VASP are modulated accordingly85. Geometric analysis of molecular extension from the N- and C- terminal positions suggests that talin could be stretched to ~100 nm or greater, presumably due to partial unfolding of mechanosensitive helical bundles that harbour cryptic vinculin binding sites85,91. Consistent with this, the position of the talin-C terminus appears to depend on vinculin in both FA and podosomes58,90. Thus, in mature IACs, talin is molecularly oriented to span from ISL through FTL and connect with the F-actin cytoskeleton in ARL85,92. Therefore, talin serves as the IAC ‘backbone’, forming the core force-transmission molecular chain that effectively templates the binding of other IAC components, most notably vinculin (Fig. 3c, 4b–d). Furthermore, since the talin dimerisation domain and an F-actin binding site are located at the very C-terminus, N-terminal integrin-binding domains of talin could conceivably capture integrins within a radius comparable to talin molecular length. This has been proposed to provide the physical basis for the minimal ligand spacing and integrin nanocluster organisation discussed earlier76. Notably, functional studies on talin mutants in Drosophila have confirmed that talin is essential for virtually all integrin functions, but suggested that talin may be organised differently in adhesions of different tissues93. Higher load-bearing structures in muscles were found to be organised like classical mammalian FA but in adhesions in the wing and epidermal cells talin could function using secondary integrinbinding sites and assemble parallel to the membrane. The importance of vinculin-talin interactions also varied with tissue and adhesion type. The extent to which this variability extends to mammalian adhesions has not been extensively investigated.

In addition to talin, the FA organisation of kindlin-2 and vinculin have been explored by SRM. Kindlin-2 localisation to ISL appears primarily dependent on its phospholipid-binding Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain88. On the other hand, multiple factors influence vinculin redistribution between ISL, FTL, and ARL. Vinculin is a conformationally autoinhibited protein with multiple binding sites for IAC proteins (Box 3)94. Binding to phospho-paxillin (Y31 and Y118) promotes ISL localisation of autoinhibited vinculin, while binding to talin favours FTL localisation58. During IAC maturation, vinculin localisation can progressively elevate to ARL58. Curiously, whereas in fibroblast and endothelial IACs, vinculin is oriented with an elevated C-terminus58,85, in pluripotent stem cells unknown molecular mechanisms invert vinculin orientation84,87. Altogether, these observations hint that certain proteins such as talin may provide a ‘chassis’-like structural framework upon which regulatable ‘moving parts’ components such as vinculin can modulate the structural, mechanical, and signalling functions of IACs95. However, current views of IAC compositional and structural organisation are static snapshots, inevitably biased toward stable and abundant structural motifs, and may overlook important dynamic aspects of IAC function.
Linking Adhesion Structure, Dynamics, and Trafficking to
Mechanosensitivity
Mechanical force has emerged as a central unifying element influencing IAC dynamics96–99. It has been well established that cellular forces generated by actin polymerization and myosin II contractility are propagated to integrin via key adaptor IAC proteins (Fig. 4d)98–100. Force transmitted through integrin to ECM is commonly described as traction force (Fig. 4c), which drives cell shape changes, cell migration, rigidity sensing, and ECM remodelling. Mechanosensitivity of IAC is highly complex and encompasses numerous aspects of IAC structure, function, and regulations, spanning from variations in IAC lifetime associated with adhesion formation, maturation, remodelling and turnover, as well as changes in the movement and interactions of individual IAC molecules in response to recruitment of new binding partners, post-translational modifications, alterations in membrane environment and mechanical deformations99. Here, building from detailed single molecule studies to targeted vesicular traffic of adhesion components, we focus our discussion on how the interplay of molecular dynamics, conformational changes, transient force-regulated protein interactions, and intracellular transport collaborate to influence IAC mechanosensitivity.
Single-molecule dynamics within adhesions.
One measure of adhesion dynamics involves the motion of individual molecules within adhesions as studied by Single-Molecule Tracking (SMT) (Box 2). As expected, this reveals the enrichment of immobilised integrins inside and diffusive integrins outside IACs. Perhaps more surprisingly, a significant fraction of diffusive integrins can also be found inside IACs, and immobilised integrins also exist outside of IACs. Integrin single-molecule dynamics also appears to be sub-type specific60, and sensitive to local cellular activity such as lamellipodial protrusion101 or membrane curvature induced by the glycocalyx102. Longer time-scale SMT revealed that integrins repeatedly entered and exited FA and underwent transient ECM- and cytoskeleton-mediated arrest both inside and outside FA, but were arrested ~80% of the time

within adhesions compared to only ~50% of the time outside adhesions. While integrins display primarily 2D diffusion characteristics, cytoplasmic IAC components can exhibit either 2D or 3D diffusion. For example, 2D diffusion of kindlin-2 and Rac1 can be attributed to their respective plasma membrane-binding sites88,103. In contrast, talin appears to become instantaneously immobilized in FA without prior inplane diffusion, indicative of its entry by 3D diffusion from a different focal plane60. Altogether, the ability of IAC proteins to freely percolate into IACs are consistent with the composite nanocluster organisation of IACs (Fig. 3a–b)60,104,105. These observations also underscored how, at the single molecule level, the dynamics of an individual IAC component is distinct from the micron-scale structural dynamics of the IAC.
Temporal responses of adhesions to applied forces.
Acute application of external force is instrumental for probing how IAC dynamics are influenced by mechanical stimuli. It is well documented that over long timescales of minutes-hours, cells respond to mechanical stretching or shear flow by concerted modulation of IAC assembly and disassembly and global cytoskeletal reorganisation to drive cell shape changes, reorientation, and activation of myriad transcription factors106,107. Force response of IAC on shorter timescale can be probed by Single-Cell Force Spectroscopy (SCFS) [Box 2], which showed that cell-ECM adhesion can be strengthened rapidly with sub-second response time108. The functions of a subset of IAC components such as integrin, talin, kindlin, FAK, and Src as well as Arp2/3 and mDia1 formin have been implicated in this process. Because this timescale is faster than visible IAC maturation [Box 1], such rapid responses potentially depends on some forms of pre-existing IAC structures, although whether these structures correspond to immobilised integrin outside of IACs observed by single-molecule analysis (Fig. 3b) remains to be established60.
The development of a substrate stretching platform compatible with SRM has revealed how acute force application elicits complex responses in cells that involve both simple elastic deformation and amplified displacement109. Differential motion observed for the N- and C-termini of talin are consistent with talin stretching, in agreement with the current model of IAC organization (Fig. 3c, 4b). Interestingly, the magnitude of actin cytoskeleton displacement is larger than the magnitude of the substrate deformation. Such overcompensated actin motion has been shown to be myosin II-dependent but the underlying mechanisms remain otherwise unclear. Responses to acute force application likely involve mechanically activated ion channels, which regulate cellular entry of various ions such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, and protons, all potent regulators of numerous signalling pathways110. Of these, the effects of calcium ions are best characterized111; for example, calpain-mediated proteolysis is known to regulate IAC disassembly112,113 via direct cleavage of core IAC proteins such as talin, FAK, or paxillin113–116. Beyond calcium, intracellular pH, which is regulated downstream of integrin-ECM engagement by proton antiporters such as the sodium hydrogen exchanger (NHE-1)117–120, is also a major regulator of cell volume, cytoskeletal dynamics, and biological activity of core IAC proteins such as talin121. The multifaceted involvement of mechanically activated ion channels in cell migration has been reviewed recently122, and their interactions with IAC mechanotransduction are now receiving increasing attention, with particular interest in the

Piezo family of ion channels which are considered to be primarily dependent on mechanical cues for their activation123.
Force-dependent protein conformational changes contribute to IAC mechanosensitivity.
In response to mechanical force, biomolecules may undergo conformational changes, while non-covalent intermolecular contacts may dissociate. These molecular events, along with mechanosensitive ion channels124, comprise the elemental steps in molecular mechanotransduction125. Direct force input by optical or magnetic tweezers (Box 2) can perturb purified protein complexes with sub-molecular precision, and has been instrumental in characterising mechanical bond dynamics of integrin and IAC proteins (i.e. catch and slip bond behaviors126). Additionally, a growing list of IAC proteins have been shown to contain mechanically sensitive domains that can be partially unfolded under physiological forces to disrupt binding sites, expose additional binding sites, or otherwise modulate biochemical activity91,127–130 (Fig 4a). Of these, cell biological observations have largely corroborated the mechanosensitive recruitment of vinculin to talin in IACs52,131–133, though force-independent steps in talin-vinculin interactions may be relevant under certain contexts134,135.
Molecular-scale force transmission in adhesions.
In IACs of living cells, mechanical force can be probed using various molecular tension gauges (Box 2), in some cases at the single-molecule level. These measurements confirmed that the direction of mechanical force supported by individual integrin is largely coaxial with IAC and F-actin alignment136, consistent with the molecular alignment of integrins determined by fluorescence anisotropy137,138. Integrin load-bearing is spatially heterogeneous and dependent on vinculin, with high-load integrins (>10 pN) enriched in pheripheral FA, while the majority of integrins sustain a minimal loading of 1–3 pN139,140. Intramolecular tension measurements in integrin αLβ2, talin, and vinculin have established their general dependence on actomyosin contractility, while unveiling the underlying molecular complexity that arises from the differential mechanobiological contribution of distinct protein moieties. For example, both NPXF motifs (binding sites for talin and kindlin-2) in the integrin β2 are required for force transmission through integrin141. Intramolecular force in talin is sensitive to substrate rigitidy, dependent on the vinculin cross-bridge with actin, and closely correlated with filament density as observed by correlative light-electron microscopy142. Talin engagement with F-actin is mediated by either central or C-terminal actin binding sites (ABS2 and ABS3, respectively), which seemingly show different affinities for stress fibers and lamellipodial F-actin networks143,144. Furthermore, the magnitude of talin intramolecular tension is clearly non-uniform, with lower tensions near the C-terminus, and higher tensions near the Nterminus145 (Fig. 4d). This complexity may be a consequence of the multiplicity of binding sites for vinculin (at least 11) and actin (at least 2) in talin, and has been proposed to play higher-order mechanosignalling roles, through combinatorial engagement of different sites that could give rise to a wide variety of signalling outcomes146. Beyond cell culture, a Drosophilamelanogasterstrain with endogenous talin completely replaced by a FRET talin tension sensor shows that as pupae develop, the magnitude of talin tension at the myotendinous junction unexpectedly and progressively decreases147, possibly due to

ongoing talin recruitment to myotendinous junctions during development, decreasing the magnitude of mechanical force per individual talin molecule.
Internally generated cellular forces arising from contractility, membrane tension, and actin polymerisation also drive various types of large-scale intracellular motion such as actin retrograde flow148. The observation that IAC proteins exhibit retrograde flow with variable degrees of coupling to actin flow is consistent with the ‘molecular clutch’ model of IAC mechanotransduction148–150 (Fig. 4c, for review see ref.151). For example, the retrograde flow vectors of talin and vinculin are moderately coupled to actin retrograde flow, while integrin, FAK, and paxillin exhibit minimal motion coupling, largely consistent with the current nanoscale structural model described above (Fig. 3c)59,148. How IAC component dynamics are converted into traction stress are, however, complex. IAC-mediated traction increases proportionally to actin retrograde flow in the slow flow regime but then decreases at flow speeds beyond ~10 nm/s152. Furthermore, IAC traction undergoes intra-IAC fluctuations153,154 and has dual actin retrograde flow-dependent and -independent components143 which may arise from differential coupling of IACs to distinct F-actin networks of lamellipodia (dendritic meshworks) and stress fibers (bundled F-actin), respectively155. Complexity is further compounded by recent studies that converge on talin as the entry point for microtubule-dependent mechanoregulatory signals via KANK proteins54,55,156.
Dynamics of protein organisation in adhesions.
IAC proteins undergo dynamic exchange with the cytoplasmic pool over time scales of minutes157–161. Largely consistent with the spatial organisation determined by proximity labeling50 and SRM59, correlative analysis of FCCS and FRAP dynamics [Box 2] identified multiple pre-complexes that can be concomitantly incorporated into or dissociated from IACs, such as the IPP complex, FAK/paxillin/Cas and Vinculin/Paxillin [Box 3]. Precomplex of vinculin with a specific binding site on talin is also shown to favor rapid IAC maturation135. Importantly, consistent with their structural and mechanical roles, increasing substrate rigidity promotes long IAC residence time in a subset of IAC components such as talin, vinculin, and tensin159.
Interestingly, the dense aggregation, dynamic exchange and the multivalent organisation of many IAC components have led to conjecture that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) could contribute to IAC dynamics and functions162. For example, LLPS of GIT1/βPIX protein complex has been reported to contribute to its signalling function in IACs163 while LLPS of p130Cas and FAK was linked to promotion of the formation of kindlin-containing molecular aggregates analogous to nascent adhesion integrin nanoclusters discussed above164. Additionally, the ability of LIMD1 to form condensates was found to be mechanosensitive and to contribute to IAC maturation and durotaxis165. LIMD1-dependent LLPS involves LIM domains and intrinsically disordered regions, common motifs in IAC components166,167. The molecular mechanisms underlying biomolecular LLPS and their potential roles in biological processes, including cell adhesion, remain active topics of research and debate162,168–170. However, while it is possible that the LLPS paradigm may be more broadly applicable to IAC functions and dynamics, it is important to note that

most characterised LLPS phenomena involve micron-scale liquid-like structures, whereas the length scale of IAC structural granularity and anisotropic compartmentalisation is at the nanoscale. This involves much fewer molecules (~10s-100s) and these length scale and stoichiometry differences may require further theoretical and experimental elaboration.
Vesicular traffic in adhesion dynamics.
IACs are highly dynamic in terms of movement of individual molecules, protein responsiveness to mechanical forces and coupling of integrin adhesion to the actin cytoskeleton. Superimposed on these molecular dynamics, IAC formation, maturation and turnover is linked to the exocytic delivery of integrins to, and endocytic removal of integrins from, adhesions. Integrins, as the major transmembrane proteins in IACs, are the primary point of regulation by vesicular trafficking but alteration in integrin levels in turn influences the integrin associated protein networks present in IACs. As vesicular trafficking of integrins has been extensively reviewed elsewhere8,171,172, we limit discussion to a few recent findings linked to IAC organisation and to mechanical regulation of integrin traffic.
Expression of β1 integrins with a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein inserted into a loop within the extracellular hybrid domain has allowed direct visualisation of integrin exocytosis and revealed that integrin exocytosis occurs preferentially in proximilty to FA173. While the mechanisms specifically driving targeted integrin exocytosis, and the functional significance of localised integrin delivery, are yet to be established, increasing evidence suggests that many cargos are delivered close to FA in processes regulated by Rab and Rho small GTPases, contractility and microtubules174–177. KANK proteins (Box 3) provide mechanosensitive mechanisms for recruitment of microtubules to adhesions43,53,54,172,178 and conventional microscopy shows KANK distributed at the edges of FA. SRM studies revealed that KANK assembles in vertical walls at the outer rim of cornerstone FA, the large adhesions found at the periphery of colonies of pluripotent stem cells87, where it is presumably well placed to link to microtubules. Microtubule targeting apparently promotes FA disassembly in several ways179–182; including, influencing local Rho signalling to myosin contractility55, delivering proteases that locally degrade the ECM177 and triggering integrin endocytosis176,181,182. How the local exocytosis of integrin heterodimers, that might be expected to promote FA growth, is spatially and temporally coordinated with exocytosis of proteases that trigger FA disassembly and integrin endocytosis, and whether KANK proteins play roles in this, has not yet been determined.
Integrin endocytosis, which can proceed through a variety of pathways, has been extensively reviewed elsewhere171,172,183. Internalised integrins are recycled from endosomes back to the cell surface via several different routes with many of the Rab GTPases regulating these processes now known and specific integrin-associated adaptors enabling selective integrin endocytosis recently identified184–187. In this regard, it is noteworthy that recently characterised αvβ5 integrin-containing atypical adhesions, variously termed reticular adhesions, clathrin plaques and flat clathrin lattices (Box 1) probably form via frustrated endocytosis, particularly under low force conditions172,188,189. These structures seem to play roles in crosstalk between adhesion signalling and growth factor signalling and, because integrin-ECM interactions may mechanically prevent internalisation of these latices, they are

likely to enhance and prolong growth factor signalling at the cell periphery190. Although αvβ5 appears to be preferentially localised to reticular adhesions, β1 integrins in tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices support 3D cell migration in collagen fibers191. In addition, the mechanical properties of the ECM and the extent of cellular contractility seem to influence integrin endocytosis through the force-regulated recruitment of endocytic adaptors to IACs. For example, Dab2, an adaptor involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, is selectively recruited to β3 integrin clusters in low force environments, preventing recruitment of other cannonical IAC components and facilitating integrin internalisation187
Open questions in mechanoregulation of adhesions.
The process by which cells generate mechanosensitive responses ultimately arise from the complex networks of molecular-scale transactions which integrate mechanical information with biochemical signals, and thus adhesion mechanoregulation is an intrinsically multiscale phenomenon. Understanding such information processing at the molecular level requires a better definition of the activity, stoichiometry, connectivity, and structural organization of IAC components, not only within the adhesions but also in their interrelated biological context. Case in point, the functions of many proteins within the current empirical list of 60 core IAC components (Supplementary Table 1) are still not well understood, especially in terms of adhesion mechanosensitivity40. In addition to cell biological characterisation, the bottom-up approach of biochemical reconstitution that could integrate adhesive components with active contractility systems192–194 will be highly instructive, while conversely, large-scale genetic screening would be important for discovery of less abundant but essential components. Notably there also remains much to explore in terms of the feedbacks between IAC mechanoregulation and regulatory mechanisms at the levels of transcription, translation, and proteostasis. As noted earlier, how mechanically regulated ion channels influence IACs, and vice versa, is another important question. Furthermore, given that thus far the majority of IAC proteins have been studied under ectopic expression conditions, the use of genome editing techniques to enable the analysis of IAC proteins under endogenous gene regulatory control and at endogenous levels of expression will be an important next step.
Imaging-based structural analysis of adhesions by SRM has been expedient but it should be highlighted that the inherent limitations of fluorescent imaging, whereby at most a few molecular species are observed at a time, inevitably mask the richly diverse molecular context surrounding any cellular structures. A more complete picture can be anticipated to emerge with recent advances in volumetric electron microscopy techniques81,195 and their correlation with fluorescence microscopy83,195,196. Integration of the wealth of quantitative findings on structure, dynamics, intracellular transport and mechanics in IACs into a comprehensive theoretical framework remains a work in progress. The relationship between IAC properties and mechanical inputs/outputs tends to be multiphasic and cannot be captured by simple deterministic models. Presently, coarse-grained models based on the ‘molecular clutch’ treatment139,149,151 can account for IAC mechanosensitivity to substrate rigidity, integrin sub-types, and ligand-spacing at the bulk population level197,198. However, a significant gap remains between the ‘understandable’ models which inevitably involve too much abstraction of molecular-scale intricacies and the atomistic molecular dynamics

simulations which are still limited in time-scale, size-scale, and length-scale. Theoretical development bridging these multi-scale structure and dynamics will be crucial for further progress in understanding IAC structure-function.
Several lines of evidence, including detailed single-molecule analysis of mechanical loads, point to the tendency of cells to overcompensate for initial mechanical stimuli. For example, mature IACs in cells, and in Drosophila myotendinous junctions, appear to contain an excess of integrins or force-bearing proteins such as talin, such that a significant proportion of these molecules barely convey mechanical loads139,140,145,147. This bias toward over-constructing mechanical structures may have adaptation advantages especially when considering that mechanical inputs that cells experience can be nearly instantaneous, far faster than the response time of biochemical feedbacks. Thus, pre-assembled mechanical structures may enable cells to counteract these mechanical and structural challenges adequately, preventing irreparable mechanically-induced cell damage. IAC over-maturation thus may serve as a feed forward control whereby cells anticipate and preadapt for further mechanical insults. In other words, overcompensated IAC assembly may provide an ‘insurance’ mechanism against mechanical disruption of tissue cells. In conjunction with this, active pathways that attenuate or disassemble IACs (such as integrin inactivation, degradation, trafficking, and turnover9,53,177) can be expected to play key roles in maintaining proper homeostatic balance. However, more work is needed to clarify this aspect of IAC regulation, especially in complex invivosettings, and in how pathological conditions may arise from their dysregulations [Box 4].
Conclusions and perspectives
It is now broadly appreciated that the dynamic, mechanosensitive behaviour of IAC components is essential in sensing the mechanobiological status of cells and in coordinating a host of cellular processes with the local mechanical environment. Many advances have relied on detailed biochemical, biophysical and proteomic studies in well-developed cell culture models, such as fibroblasts spreading on rigid model ECMs, but the task of leveraging what we have learned at the molecular and cellular scales into invivofunctional and pathological insights remain very much a work in progress. A common thread emerging from various molecular-scale interrogations is the tendency of mechanosensitive IAC assemblies to overshoot the input mechanical stimuli. In this light, aspects of physiological dysfunctions associated with IAC dysregulation, such as in fibrosis, aging, or cancer metastasis, could perhaps be seen as arising when the pro-migratory, pro-contractility mechanosensitive apparatus is out of control. How cells tune mechanosensitive circuitry to calibrate their proper mechanobiological responses invivois an important question that needs greater definition. In physiological settings, IACs are present and essential but their manifestations are highly dependent on cell type and tissue contexts, and often highly divergent from IACs in cell culture. We consider it likely that the structural organisation and behaviour of IAC modular nanoclusters is maintained and functionally relevant in tissue cells, but bringing nanoscale experimental precision [Box 2] to either the invivocontext or to otherwise sufficiently complex experimental model systems remains technically challenging. Nonetheless, continued studies probing the similarities and differences between adhesion organization in 2D and 3D matrix are essential. We also note

that, to date, detailed investigations in IACs have focused overwhelmingly on a subset of the 24 known mammalian integrins, predominantly α5β1, αvβ3, αIIbβ3 and a few leukocyte integrins. Given that virtually all invivoECMs are heterogeneous mixtures, that most cells express multiple integrin subtypes, and the crosstalk between different integrins and between integrins and non-integrin co-receptors73, it is virtually guaranteed that many salient aspects of invivoIACs are yet to be discovered. Technologically sophisticated but relatively low throughput techniques have been instrumental for dissecting IAC structure, functions, and dynamics thus far, which perhaps in part limit the range of model systems studied. Future efforts to streamline, multiplex, and democratise advanced experimental techniques will be key to tackling the complexity of IAC functions at tissue and organismal levels.

Integrin-based adhesions
There is considerable heterogeneity in IACs and, while strict definitions have not been uniformly established, IACs have been classified based on size, composition, lifetime, cellular distribution and function9,189,206,207. In some cases, differences represent steps along a maturation process (depicted in the cartoon of a top view of a polarised migrating fibroblast) while others are more specialised, or cell-type specific structures.
Nascent Adhesions are the first adhesion structures identifiable during lamellipodial extension, forming at the cell edge, containing ~50 integrins and having a diameter of <0.5 μm9,62. In addition to integrin, these structures are enriched for kindlin, talin, FAK, paxillin and α-actinin. Nascent adhesions are transient, either disassembling or maturing into larger focal complexes.
Filopodia-tip adhesions are small IACs composed of a unique subset of adhesome proteins, enriched in myosin X and distinct from other adhesions208,209. Upon stabilisation, filopodia-tip adhesions can give rise to nascent adhesions and mature into focal adhesions208.

Focal complexes are small (<1 μm) dot-like adhesions formed at the transition zone between the lamellum and lamellipodium. These structures contain core IAC components, link to the actin cytoskeleton and strengthen in response to forces.
Focal adhesions (FA), the most extensively studied and best characterised adhesions, form as focal complexes mature in response to increased forces applied from actomyosin contractility or through externally applied forces9,189,207. Force-mediated recruitment of additional IAC proteins promotes a stronger association between integrin and actin and allows assembly of ordered elongated structures structure with sizes of ~ 2–5 μm.
Fibrillar adhesions can arise from further maturation of FA in some cell types. These long thin or beaded structures are centrally located, vary in length (~1–10 μm) and are characterised by enrichment of the ECM protein fibronectin, its receptor, α5β1 integrin, and the cytoplasmic actin-binding protein tensin. Integrins in fibrillar adhesions mediate fibronectin fibrillogenesis9,207.
Invadosomes (invadopodia and podosomes) are small (~2 μm diameter) cylindrical structures containing typical IAC proteins but are also rich in actin regulators gelsolin, Arp2/3, (N-) WASP, adaptor proteins Tks4 and Tks5. They are generally termed invadopodia in cancer cells and podosomes in normal cells, such as macrophages, osteoclasts and endothelial cells207. Unlike FA, they have been associated with reduced cellular tension and are organised with a central actin core surrounded by actin regulators and signalling proteins. Forces generated by polymerisation of the actin core drive protrusion from the cell body and are associated with local matrix metalloprotease activation.
Reticular adhesions (clathrin plaques, flat clathrin lattices) are recently characterised, atypical αvβ5-containing adhesions, probably formed via frustrated endocytosis, particularly under low force conditions172,188,189. They lack many of classical IAC components, including talin and a link to the actin cytoskeleton, but are enriched in endocytic components, including clathrin and endocytic adaptors Numb and Dab2 and have important roles in cell migration, signalling and coordination of mitosis45.
Hemidesmosomes are specialised epithelial adhesions linking basement membrane laminins to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton via α6β4 integrins206. They lack canonical IAC proteins and instead are enriched for transmembrane proteins bullous pemphigoid antigen 180 and the tetraspanin CD151 and cytoplasmic plakin proteins (plectin and BP230) that link to intermediate filament cytoskeleton and can also crosslink actin and intermediate filaments. Hemidesmosomes can form adjacent to FA and mechanical and signalling crosstalk between hemidesmosomes and FA influences stable adhesion and migration207.

Toolbox for investigating IAC mechanobiology
Over the past 20 years, a wide variety of tools have been used for both the application and readout of mechanical force at IACs210. The tools highlighted here, in conjunction with genetic, pharmacological, cell biological, and biomaterials perturbations have transformed our understanding of IAC mechanobiology.
Direct Force Application. Optical/magnetic tweezers can deliver targeted force to cells using optical/magnetic beads coated with the appropriate adhesion receptor ligand. Alternatively, a family of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) techniques, can use functionalised tips of cantilevers to probe cells. Cells can also be positioned on cantilevers or micropipettes to probe the mechanical responses of the adhesive contact, such as in Single Cell Force Spectroscopy108. More global acute force application to IACs are commonly applied by stretching elastic substrates109,211.
Super-resolution Microscopy (SRM). Imaging cellular structures beyond the diffraction limit often involves a trade-off between imaging speed, range, spatial resolution, livecell compatibility, data throughput, and method complexity. For probing nanoscale organisation in fixed specimens, STED (Stimulated Emission Depletion) microscopy and single-molecule localisation microscopy can achieve ~20 nm resolution in 2D (x,y) but higher z resolution requires more specialised interferometric systems such as iPALM (interferometric PhotoActivated Localisation Microscopy)57. For live-cell imaging, Structured Illumination Microscopy offers a versatile approach but with the spatial resolution generally limited to the 100–200 nm range.

Single-molecule tracking (SMT). Motion of integrin and other IAC proteins in live cells can be imaged using TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) microscopy or a similar illumination configuration, followed by tracking and statistical analysis of motion characteristics60,103,212,213. SMT trajectory can be categorised as random (Brownian) diffusion, sub-diffusive confined diffusion, immobilised, and active transport, which report on local microenvironment, binding interactions, and ensemble heterogeneity212. A key technical limitation of SMT has been the short (typically a few seconds) observation lifetime due to photobleaching, but recent photostability enhancement have enabled ultra-long trajectory analysis of integrins104.
Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS). FCS and a related method,
Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy, is based on statistical analysis of the fluorescence fluctuations, which can be used to infer stoichiometry, diffusion coefficients, and protein-protein interactions. Due to its reliance on fluctuations, FCS is primarily suitable for probing IAC proteins in small diffusible complexes62.
Fluorescence Recovery/Loss After Photobleaching/Photoactivation (FRAP/FLAP). Spatiotemporal dynamics in IACs in the seconds and microns regime can be probed by FRAP or FLAP which monitor the exchange of fluorescently-tagged proteins between IAC-resident and cytoplasmic pools. The exchange lifetimes of various IAC proteins have been shown to exhibit different correlation with contractility and substrate rigidity159.
Traction force microscopy (TFM) and micropillar array. Traction force exerted by cells can deform pliable substrates, and thus force vectors can be inferred. Microfabricated elastomeric structures such as micropillar array can probe force readouts at discrete points. In contrast, TFM made use of continuum substrate with randomly distributed fiducial marks but require mathematical reconstruction of force vectors210. Development of SRM-enhanced TFM has enabled higher-resolution force measurements to be performed214.
Molecular tension sensors. Biopolymers such as DNA or proteins with calibrated force-extension relationship can be used as a molecular tension gauge akin to a spring in a mechanical balance. Commonly used modes of optical read-outs include Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and dequenching or binding-induced fluorescence215–218. Extracellular tension sensors incorporating ligand, such as RGD, can measure forces exerted through integrins. This class of sensors can utilise optimal synthetic fluorophores and permit single-molecule sensitivity217. Intracellular tension sensors based on fluorescent proteins FRET-pairs have the advantage of being genetically encoded but the typical photostability limitations of fluorescent proteins. Active development continues to add to a large library of IAC protein tension sensors (see 219 for technical discussion).

Key IAC proteins
The core integrin adhesome contains many proteins. Integrins are discussed in detail in the main text, but here we highlight a small subset of other adhesome proteins with well-established roles in IACs.
Talins (talin 1 and 2) are large (~270 kDa) proteins that contains an N-terminal head, composed of an atypical FERM domain (with four subdomains F0, F1, F2 and F3) that binds to the integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tail, destabilising the association between the α- and β-subunits, favouring integrin extension33–35. The head also contains binding sites for phosphoinositide lipids, Rap1 GTPases and F-actin. Talin head connects to the rod via a flexible linker containing a calpain cleavage site. The rod is composed of 13 helical bundles and contains additional binding sites for integrin, vinculin (at least 11), actin (at least 2), KANK and other IAC proteins. Homodimerisation occurs via the C-terminus. Talin binding partners regulate its transitions between a compact, globular auto-inhibited form where the head binds helical bundles from the rod, and an extended active form that can link activate integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, provide a molecular scaffold for IAC assembly, and transmit and respond to mechanical force.
Vinculin is a conformationally autoinhibited ~120 kDa protein with multiple binding sites for other IAC proteins. Its N-terminal domain binds talin, α-actinin or its own C-terminal domain during autoinhibition, while C-terminal domains can bind F-actin, paxillin and PIP2 phosphoinositides94. By binding talin and F-actin, vinculin reinforces the talin-mediated integrin-actin connection.
Kindlins are a family of 3 (kindlin-1, −2 and −3) atypical FERM domain-containing proteins20,33,220. The kindlin FERM is most closely related to that of talin but, uniquely, contains a PH domain inserted in the F2 subdomain. Kindlin binding to integrin β cytoplasmic tails contributes to integrin activation and links integrins to other IAC components, notably the IPP complex and paxillin. Unlike talin or vinculin, most evidence suggests kindlins are not regulated by autoinhibition but oligomerisation may regulate kindlin functions220,221. Loss-of-function kindlin-1 and kindlin-3 mutations cause Kindler syndrome20,33,222,223 and leukocyte adhesion deficiency type-III20,33,222,223 respectively.
IPP complex - the IPP complex is an essential trimeric protein complex made up of the pseudokinase integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and its obligate partners PINCH1 or PINCH2 and α, β or γ parvin. The N-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain of ILK engages the first of PINCH’s five LIM domain while the C-terminal ILK pseudokinase domain binds the second CH domain of parvin11. The IPP complex can scaffold many adaptor and signalling proteins including kindlin (via ILK), paxillin (via parvin) and Rsu1 (via PINCH) and apparently directly links to actin (via both PINCH and parvin).
KANKs are a family of 4 related proteins (KANK1–4) recently implicated in controlling IAC functions. KANKs contain an N-terminal talin-binding KN motif, a central coiledcoil domain that mediates oligomerisation and a C-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain.

KANKs localise to the periphery of mature FAs and modulate IACs by binding talin, altering its activation state and its link to F-actin, by modulating Rho activity and, through interactions with the cortical microtubule stabilising complex (CMSC), by recruiting microtubules to IACs influencing IAC turnover43,53–55,156,172,178.
Paxillin, and the related Hic-5 and leupaxin, are key IAC adaptor proteins51,224. Paxillin is an essential 68 kDa, tyrosine-phosphorylated protein composed of an N-terminal portion containing multiple LD motifs followed by 4 tandem LIM domains at the C-terminus. Paxillin binding proteins include parvin, kindlin, vinculin, talin, FAK and Cas.
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), contains an N-terminal FERM domain, a central tyrosine kinase domain and a C-terminal focal adhesion-targeting domain that binds talin and paxillin among other proteins225. FAK phosphorylation of IAC substrates, such as paxillin, generates additional protein interaction sites regulating FA growth and dynamics.

Dysregulation of integrin adhesions
Given their diverse roles in cell behaviour, it is unsurprising that perturbations in IAC composition, assembly or function are linked to a broad range of pathologies including developmental disorders, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, fibrosis and cancer6,8, and that integrins are potential therapeutic targets in these areas13.
Diseases linked to mutations in IAC components.
Mutations in at least 52 adhesome genes are reported to cause specific genetic diseases222. In the case of integrins, loss-of-function mutations in either subunit of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3, which normally binds fibrinogen to support platelet aggregation, causes the bleeding disorder Glanzmann thrombasthenia226. Notably, β3 also pairs with αv subunits and β3 mutations are also associated with cardiovascular disorders and increased cancer risk222. Mutations in the α7 integrin disrupts ECM-attachment of muscle cells, resulting in muscular dystrophy222, suggesting that integrin-mediated attachments operate in parallel with the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, with disruption of either leading to cycles of mechanical failures causing muscular dystrophies. Indeed, viral delivery of the α7 gene prolongs survival in mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy227. Loss of the hemidesmosomal (Box 1) integrin α6β4 results in defective keratinocyte adhesion to basement membrane laminins, leading to the skin blistering disease junctional epidermolysis bullosa222,228. Notably, keratinocytes also adhere to the basement membrane via FA-localised α3β1 integrins and loss-offunction α3 mutations in humans and mice results in skin fragility as well as lung and kidney defects222,228. Finally, loss-of-function mutations in β2 integrins impairs leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, preventing extravasation from the bloodstream, causing the rare primary immunodeficiency, leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) type I223. LAD can also arise due to mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that, for unknown reasons, impair monocyte integrin activation (LADIV)223,229, while LAD-III, which combines features of both LAD-I and Glanzmann thrombasthenia, occurs due to defective activation of haematopoietic β1, β2 and β3 integrins, arising from loss of the integrin-activating protein kindlin-320,33,222,223. Similarly, loss of the epithelial-restricted kindlin-1 causes Kindler syndrome, a disorder characterised by skin blistering, poikiloderma and photosensitivity caused by defective keratinocyte adhesion to the epidermal basement membrane20,33,222. In addition to impairing cell adhesion, it is conceivable that IAC protein mutations may drive disease by altering force transmission, cytoskeletal linkage and signalling. For example, mutations in filamins, vinculin, metavinculin, α-actinins and ZASP are linked to cardiomyopathies, myopathies, skeletal and connective tissue disorders and kidney disease222,230. The central role of adhesion in cell behaviour, makes it likely that disease-associated IAC protein mutations will continue to be uncovered.
IACs in Fibrosis.

contractility during wound healing and tissue remodelling, and has been implicated in 45% of deaths in the industrialised world231,232. Various stimuli, but particularly chronic inflammation, drive fibrosis and this involves communication between multiple cell types231,232. The major pro-fibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is stored as an ECM-bound non-covalent complex of the latency associated peptide (LAP) and the proteolytically processed TGFβ cytokine, and regulated, site-specific integrin αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6 or αvβ8 binding to the LAP triggers either mechanical or force-independent TGFβ release24,231–233 permitting binding and activation of TGFβ receptors. Small molecule αv integrin inhibitors are therefore potential novel oral therapeutics for fibrotic disorders13,231,232. IAC signalling in response to binding the stiff fibrotic matrix also leads to alterations in cell morphology, contractility, migration and proliferation that contribute to fibrotic disease7,231,232.
Adhesion remodelling in aging.
Connections from integrin-based cell adhesion to cellular senescence have been inferred in multiple pathological contexts, including cardiovascular diseases and fibrosis234–237, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still emerging. Senescence is associated with morphological changes characteristic of cells adhering to stiff ECM (e.g. increased spreading area, reduced cell motility, increased FAK and paxillin phosphorylation, and high Rac1 and cdc42 activity)238. Signalling from multiple integrins has been implicated in pro-senescent responses. Integrin β3 expression is increased in senescent fibroblasts, activating the TGF-β pathway driving senescent phenotypes239. Binding of heparan sulphate proteoglycan and CCN1 by integrin α6β1 induces p53 and Rac1-Nox1 signalling leading to ROS-dependent activation of the pRb DNA damage response pathway that leads to fibroblast senescence235. Endothelial cells senescence increases traction forces, generating prominent actin stress fibres and FA, impairing remodelling and reorientation in response to shear flow240,241. In one recent study, age-associated loss of the FA-localised βPIX/GIT complex correlates with induced cellular senescence, via increased calpain cleavage of amphiphysin1. This results in reduced clathrin-mediated integrin endocytosis disrupting integrin signalling and ROS production. GIT1/2 competes with calpain cleavage of paxillin counteracting this effect242. Interestingly, βPIX is enriched in nascent adhesions and negatively regulates FA maturation243. Thus, mechanotransduction pathways associated with FA maturation could be coupled to senescence, however, the extent to which the senescent-associated hyperadhesive state contributes to senescence progression, rather than occurring as a consequence of agingassociated dysfunction, has not been fully characterised.

Figure 4 |. Molecular-scale mechanoregulation of IACs.
a | Mechanotransduction by force-dependent conformational changes. Several IAC proteins such as talin, vinculin, RIAM, α-actinin, KANK1 and filamin A contain domains that can be partially unfolded under piconewton physiological forces91,127–130. For example, talin R3 domain is a 4-bundle of α-helix that contains a binding site for RIAM. RIAM can bind talin under low intramolecular tension but upon the increase in intramolecular tension, R3 undergoes partial unfolding that displaces RIAM and in turn exposes a binding site to vinculin128. b | Integrin-Talin-Actin as the structural and mechanical ‘backbone’ of the IACs.

force transmission in integrin-talinvinculin-actin complexes. Single-integrin force vector is primarily co-aligned with the F-actin orientation, potentially implicating a significant degree of tilting and stretching of the integrin ectodomain136,137. Integrin force is thought to be transmitted via talin, which may serve as a force aggregator as reflected by the intramolecular force gradient due to multiple vinculin and actin binding sites144,145. Loadbearing by integrin and talin are variable with high-load bearing molecules (>10 pN) comprising a subpopulation, dependent on vinculin139,145. Thus at steady-state only a subset of integrin-talin-vinculin-actin complexes in IACs are fully tensioned139.
