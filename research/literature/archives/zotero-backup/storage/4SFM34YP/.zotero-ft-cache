Abstract
Single cell biomechanics is concerned with the viscoelastic properties of
biological organisms on the length scales of whole cells and the macro
molecules that comprise them (tens of microns to nanometres). This is
an area of increasing research interest, with biomechanics being found to
affect many healthy and diseased states of the cell. Many cell types are
sensitive to the mechanical properties of their surroundings, which affects
not only their own mechanical properties, but also such diverse things as
mitotic cell division and stem cell differentiation. In probing cell mechan
ics, the cytoskeleton is of particular interest due to its multifaceted role; it
is a prestressed network of proteinaceous filaments and cross-linkers which
has been described as the source of order in the cell. The cytoskeleton is
crucial to mechanosensing, force transduction, cell motility and division,
and to regulation of the mechanical properties of cells. Many diseases are
pathologies of the cytoskeleton, and it is a common target for anti-cancer
drugs.
Here are included novel measurements using Brillouin light scattering in
cluding those of live cells demonstrating the potential for live cell study.
Finally, the results from different techniques are compared, contrasted and
discussed. Actin disruption in live cells by 1➭M latrunculin B was found
by external passive microrheology to reduce geometric stiffness by 4 N/m
iii


after 40 minutes (median from 11 cells); a time course experiment with
phonon microscopy found longitudinal elasticity reduced by 3.6% after 26
minutes with continued slow softening over 2 hours. To my knowledge, no
prior publications report a time course of cell elasticity during cytoskeletal
disruption. Microrheology experiments without drug treatment revealed
cells stiffening 2 N/m and while cytoskeletal active strain rate decreased,
the stress rate increased; this is the first such observation of changes in cell
stress rate.
This thesis is concerned with the measurement of cellular viscoelasticity,
and bringing together information from two measurement techniques which
probe vastly different aspects of cell mechanics. The bulk of the thesis fo
cusses on microrheology of living cells, with an analogy developed between
a bead bound to the cell and an optically trapped bead: first a theoretical
framework is built for data interpretation; next microrheological analyses
are developed for measurements with optical tweezers; then results obtained
from non-invasive measurements of live cells are presented and discussed.
Phonon microscopy, based upon picosecond laser ultrasound, is detailed
and applied to cell measurements; study of cytoskeletal dynamics within
live cells is demonstrated.

Statement of Contribution
The optical trapping microscope detailed in Chapter 3 was already built
at the time I started this work. Due to changes in laser safety rules, I had
to redesign, rebuild, and realign the optical system. Removing a lens from
the beam path to change the focal position of the bead was my idea. Data
acquisition for particle tracking experiments was performed using custom
software designed and developed by myself and run within Micro-Manager.
Confocal images in Chapter 4 were from cells cultured and stained by my
self with the guidance of Kerry Setchfield and Alan Huett, and imaging
was performed by me using the Zeiss Airyscan 2 Confocal Laser Scanning
Microscope at the Nanoscale and Microscale Research Centre in Notting
ham.
Passively measuring cell rheology using optical trapping and functionalised
beads was first suggested by Manlio Tassieri and the optical trapping anal
ogy was demonstrated by Rebecca Warren[1]. This prior work did not
include observations of active strain generation, nor did it include the de
tailed quantitative analysis that I developed and demonstrate in Chapter
4. Interpretation of the results in the context of cellular response to bead
binding is my own. Numerical methods for quantification of microrheology
measurements were designed and developed by myself under the guidance
of Manlio Tassieri. Elements of the work in Chapters 3 and 4 has been
viii


published under the title “Living Cells as a Biological Analog of Optical
Tweezers – a Non-Invasive Microrheology Approach” and presented at sev
eral conferences.
The phonon microscope was built by Fernando P ́erez-Cota circa 2016[2],
and I helped to deconstruct and rebuild it during the course of this work,
including redesigning the optical paths to allow multiple experiments using
the same laser system and integration of fluorescent imaging used during
live cell experiments. I automated the fluorescent imaging with control of
illumination LEDs and software to integrate image acquisition into the ex
periment. Use of an infra-red probe beam to study live cells had not been
demonstrated prior to this work and the experiments performed to probe
the contribution of the actin cytoskeleton were of my design. Aspects of
the cell death study in Chapter 5 have been published under the title “Pi
cosecond Ultrasonics For Elasticity-Based Imaging And Characterization
Of Biological Cells” and presented at BioBrillouin conference.

Chapter 1
Introduction
1.1 Introduction to Mechanobiology
To define mechanobiology I turn to the words of revered mechanobiologist,
Donald Ingber[3]:
“The recent convergence between physics and biology has led many physi
cists to enter the fields of cell and developmental biology. One of the most
exciting areas of interest has been the emerging field of mechanobiology that
centres on how cells control their mechanical properties, and how physical
forces regulate cellular biochemical responses, a process that is known as
mechanotransduction”
Current understanding of mechanobiology highlights the importance of
length scales and time scales. Starting at the top, an organism is made
up of organs, organs are made up of tissues, tissues are made up of cells
and extra-cellular matrix, both of which are made up of molecules[4]. At
every scale, there is order and organisation which contribute to the func
tion of that “component”. Order is characterised by molecules within liv
1


1.1. INTRODUCTION TO MECHANOBIOLOGY
ing systems being far from thermal equilibrium - proteins are folded and
not aggregated, and information is stored not dissipated. Organisation is
characterised by the concentration gradients maintained across different
membranes within a living system. The primary interest of this thesis is
at the interface of the cellular and molecular scales; at this scale there are
many questions in the fundamental science that are unanswered.
We know that mechanics are implicated in diseases at the cellular scale:
there are many diseases of mechanotransduction[3], meaning a dysfunc
tional cellular response to forces and mechanical properties is at the core
of the disease. Other diseases are caused by cytoskeletal dysfunction[5–7].
Many of each are characterised by a change in the mechanical properties
of the cells in question[5, 8, 9]. During metastases, cancer cells will spend
some time in an adherent state when invading tissues and some time in
a suspension state when circulating in the blood supply; throughout this,
they are able to regulate their mechanical properties and apply forces upon
their environment, enabling them to travel through the body where they
sustain wide ranges of hydrostatic pressure and shear stresses[10, 11].
Mechanics are not just relevant to disease. The mechanical properties
of a cell’s milieu affects its behaviour[12, 13], morphology[14], and fate
(resultant cell type after differentiation of stem cells)[15, 16]. I consider
this adequate justification for why further interdisciplinary research into
mechanobiology has great potential, not just as an interesting research
question but also to develop medicines and improve lives.
2


1.2. THE CYTOSKELETON
1.2 The Cytoskeleton
Scaling down from cells and tissues to biomolecules, the concept of the
cytoskeleton has been especially useful. Present in almost all known cells[4,
17], the cytoskeleton is a network of filamentous proteins[18], regulated by
a suite of accessory proteins which can modulate the stability of fibres and
polarity of cells, or generate forces required for both cell movement and for
intracellular transport[19].
Taking guidance from the words of Paul Weiss;
“Lest our necessary and highly successful preoccupation with cell fragments
and fractions obscure the fact that the cell is not just an inert playground
for a few almighty masterminding molecules, but is a system, a hierar
chically ordered system, of mutually interdependent species of molecules,
molecular groupings, and supramolecular entities; and that life, through
cell life, depends on the order of their interactions” [20]
I note that the cytoskeleton is regulated by a large number of proteins,
many of which have received little study[21]. Thus a bottom-up study of
cellular mechanobiology (i.e. in-vitro mechano-biochemistry such as rheol
ogy measurements of actin solutions) can only capture a tiny snapshot of
what happens inside live cells. Equally, the regulation of the cytoskeleton
by the environment of the cell (both chemical and mechanical) means it is
hard to translate experiments at the cellular scale to in-vivo understanding.
The two cytoskeletal filaments which have received the most attention are
actin filaments and microtubules, which are conserved across all eukaryotic
cells and some prokaryotes[4, 17]. Intermediate filaments are a broader
class with 6 types expressed in different tissues[22], including alpha-keratin
which makes hair and nails. Greater in number, however, are the proteins
3


1.2. THE CYTOSKELETON
Figure 1.1: The Cytoskeleton of an Adherent Cell Schematic of an adherent cell, showing focal adhesions binding to a substrate via fibronectin coated onto the substrate. The actin cytoskeleton is connected to fibronectin coated on the substrate via focal adhesions, and to the microtubule organising centre (MOC) via microtubules. Two types of motor protein are shown: myosin cross-links actin fibres, and kinesin transports vesicles along the microtubules.
which interact with either of these filaments[18], including motor proteins
such as myosin which generates stress by cross-linking actin filaments[23].
Actin filaments have a diameter of 7 nm and 0.3-10 ➭m in length, while mi
crotubules are 25 nm in diameter and 1-100 ➭m in length[24]. The key dif
ference to their function, however, is not the dimensions but the mechanics
and organisation. Actin is a semi-flexible polymer, with persistence length
(a measure of stiffness) of around 10 ➭m[25, 26], while microtubules are
stiffer with a persistence length of up to millimetres[27, 28]. Actin mostly
localises to a cortical layer around 200 nm thick, while microtubules radiate
from microtubule organizing centres within the cell. This organisation is
shown in Figure 1.1 along with motor proteins and focal adhesions where
the cytoskeleton links to the extracellular matrix.
The actin cortex is reported to provide the cell with the majority of its
resistance to deformation. Constant turnover of filaments drives contrac
tility and motility[29, 30], and is crucial to force balance between the cell
and its surroundings[31] (either extra-cellular matrix or other cells). The
4


1.3. CELL LINES
microtubule network is less dynamic[32], and aside from acting as transport
routes for kinesin, the rigid struts are somewhat analogous to tent poles[33].
Compression in microtubules balances tension in the actin cortex[34], and
they also act as mechanotransducers, transmitting forces to the interior of
the cell[33].
In the tent analogy of cell mechanics, the pegs which anchor the cell and
transmit forces to its surroundings are focal adhesions. In vivo, focal ad
hesions facilitate cell motility and support prestress by integrin receptors
binding to extracellular matrix proteins[35]. A variety of signalling path
ways, both biochemical and mechanical, accompany focal adhesion matura
tion after integrin binding and lead to recruitment of cytoskeletal proteins
such as actin, vimentin and talin[36, 37]. The mechanical coupling of the
extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton allows cells to sense forces from
and mechanical properties of their surroundings[38].
1.3 Cell Lines
Immortalised cell lines are a key tool for biological research, with most in
vitro study using stable cell lines rather than primary cells directly from a
donor. The first immortalised human cells and now the most common cell
line, HeLa cells, have been widely used over the last 70 years and much
of what we know about both physiological and pathological processes in
human cells comes from study of HeLa cells[39]. As a rough metric for
their ubiquity, a PubMed search for articles in the last 20 years mentioning
“HeLa cells” returns almost 80,000 articles, while similar searches for the
next two most common human cell lines, “HEK cells” and “MCF-7 cells”,
returned around 10,000 and 40,000 articles respectively.
5


1.3. CELL LINES
HeLa cells, named after their donor Henrietta Lacks, are the subject of an
ethical debate because Henrietta Lacks (the tissue donor) did not consent
for her biopsy to be used in research. Public opinions on this case have lead
to regulatory changes, including the requirement of informed consent for
participation in studies. While HEK cells, an acronym for Human Embry
onic Kidney, are not subject to this debate, bioethics in the Netherlands
in 1977 were in their infancy with the legalisation of abortion in 1984[40],
making it unlikely that consent was obtained for the use of aborted fetal
tissue.
As they are the most studied and characterised cell line, cessation of the
use of HeLa cells would necessitate huge repetition of scientific endeavours.
Furthermore, the ethical issues around consent are not unique to HeLa
cells as there was little call for regulation regarding the use of tissues from
live patients until the 1970s[41]; this means the next two most common
human cell lines are likely subject to similar ethical issues surrounding their
origin. Phasing out the use of cells with ethical qualms about their origins
would necessitate researchers discarding decades of research performed on
numerous cell lines, making it inpractical and wasteful.
In this work, HeLa cells are used to study the mechanics of cellular adhesion
and cytoskeletal disassembly. The cytoskeleton is highly conserved across
eukaryotic cells[4], with actin expression being ubiquitious. The interac
tion being studied here is that triggered by the binding of streptavidin to
integrin receptors, an interaction where HeLa cells are believed to behave
similarly to other cell lines[42, 43]. HeLa cells are the most widely used
cellular model system and have been studied in great detail[39]. Despite
this, it is worth acknowledging that HeLa cells are not always “typical”
cells. The techniques/methods developed on HeLa cells can, however, be
transferred to a system of specific relevance to a future biological question.

1.4. OBJECTIVES OF THE THESIS
1.4 Objectives of the Thesis
The objective of this thesis is to develop non-invasive biomechanical mea
surements which are compatible with live cell study, and to compare results
from different techniques probing different length and time scales. The two
techniques I have chosen, microrheology and phonon microscopy, each have
unique strengths and challenges in implementation. The aims for each dif
fer due to the various challenges presented by the two techniques. Herein I
present External Passive Microrheology (EPM), a method and novel anal
ysis for measuring the viscoelastic properties and active stress generation of
single live cells, and development of phonon microscopy for live cell study.
External Passive Microrheology will be applied to study the mechanical
effects of cytoskeletal processes in live cells without deforming cells by ap
plying external forces. To this end, data acquisition needs to be developed
and optimised to allow thousands of images per second to be acquired,
and processed to track the position of a microsphere which will be stored
for further processing. Development of analysis methods is needed to in
terpret particle tracking experiments to find the mechanical properties of
the sample; this includes a new theoretical framework based upon conven
tional analysis of optical trapping data and improved to account for the
complexities of live cell study. Concerned with these goals are Chapters 3
and 4.
Phonon microscopy will be used to measure the change in mechanical
properties of cells with higher spatio-temporal resolution than offered by
microrheology. First, the sensitivity will be confirmed by study of the
effect of cytoskeletal targetting drugs applied before fixing cells. Transi
tioning to live cell work, biocompatibility will be the biggest challenge.
Previous phonon microscopy has used ultraviolet pump beams, however
7


1.4. OBJECTIVES OF THE THESIS
infrared wavelengths are expected to be more biocompatible. To make
this change, opto-acoustic transducer designs need to be trialled with the
aim of enabling longer experiments; experimental protocols for live cells
also need consideration. Sample heating during the creation of coherent
acoustic pulses introduces a systematic error on measurements of Brillouin
frequency, necessitating internal controls in experimental design for live cell
work. The effect of cytoskeletal disruption on live cells will be investigated,
including a spatially resolved time course of cell elasticity during disruption
of actin. All work towards these aims is contained within Chapter 5.

Background
The roles that forces and mechanics play in the behaviour of tissues and
cells has been of increasing interest in the last thirty years[3, 44–46]. A suite
of techniques, made possible by technological advances, are now available
for studying the mechanics of cells[6, 47–52]; this in turn has resulted in a
suite of mechanical models for cells, in order to understand the results from
those techniques[53–55]. Fundamental mechanobiology, i.e. how do forces
and mechanics matter to cells, presents many interesting questions such
as how do cells sense forces and respond[45, 56–58]. These, however, are
little good to society without asking also “how does this affect the health
of an organism?” thus researchers have sought to understand the interplay
between biomechanics, mechanotransduction and disease[8, 9, 59–62].
In this work I employ two different approaches to characterising different
mechanical properties of single live HeLa cells. External Passive Microrhe
ology (EPM, Chapter 4), a technique I have developed, uses optical trap
ping to position a bead on the surface of a cell where it adheres, before the
trap is turned off. Particle tracking microrheology is then used to infer both
the complex shear modulus and the active stress generation of the cell as

the adhesion site develops over tens of minutes. Phonon Microscopy (PM,
Chapter 5) uses a femtosecond laser pulses to generate and detect coherent
acoustic pulses within a cell, probing the longitudinal elastic modulus of
the cell during disruption of the actin network.
The two techniques introduced above probe different viscoelastic param
eters of the cell and vastly different time scales. EPM reports the shear
modulus over milliseconds to tens of seconds and stress generation of cells
over hundreds of seconds, and cells are modelled as soft viscoelastic ma
terials. PM measures the longitudinal modulus at timescales less than a
nanosecond, where cells behave like compressible elastic solids. Both ap
ply low strains to the cells, meaning effects like fluidisation can be ignored
(more detail on this in Section 2.2.5). Crucially, PM can resolve sub-cellular
structures with ∼ 1 s temporal resolution while EPM has no spatial reso
lution and temporal resolution of over one minute.
This section aims to critically compare single-cell biomechanics measure
ment techniques, the models used to interpret the techniques, and how
each has contributed to our understanding of the field. The relevant rheol
ogy and microrheology theory is explained in Section 2.2, with Figure 2.2
showing the deformation geometries for different viscoelastic moduli. The
physics underpinning optical trapping and Brillouin scattering is explained
in Section 2.3. Finally the impact of this work is discussed in the context
of the field in Section 2.4.
2.1 Single-Cell Biomechanics
Many techniques measure subtly different parameters of the cell, at dif
ferent length and time scales, such that their findings are not directly

comparable. To further complicate any comparison, cells do not behave
as ideal viscoelastic materials and exhibit a yield strain which may be as
low as a few percent[63, 64]. Thus techniques have been divided into two
categories: active techniques in which an external force is applied to the
cell, and passive techniques in which there is not; they are summarised in
Tables 2.2 and 2.1 respectively. Four models of particular interest have
been identified and summarised in Figure 2.1. References to the tables and
figure have been omitted from the text to improve readability.

2.1. SINGLE-CELL BIOMECHANICS
2.1.1 Active Techniques
Active techniques for probing single cell mechanics, that is to say methods
where an external force is applied to cells, are listed in Table 2.2. Below I
divide them based upon the length-scale probed.
2.1.1.1 Whole Cell Deformations
The first single-cell biomechanics measurements were made by deforming
whole cells via micropipette aspiration (MA). A pipette with internal di
ameter less than the size of a cell is pressed against the cell and hydrostatic
pressure is used to aspirate the cell partially into the pipette[47, 70, 80]. In
early experiments, researchers identified that small cellular deformations
are dominated by the elasticity of a cortical layer of the cell (referred to
as membrane tension), while larger deformations cause the cell to flow in a
viscous manner. Thus the cell was modelled as an elastic cortex filled with
viscous cytoplasm.
The simple model used for micropipette aspiration is useful for analysing
large and fast deformations of suspension cells. One application is deforma
bility flow cytometry (DFC), in which cells are individually subjected to
shear or extensional stress (depending on the geometry used) of up to
kPa[71, 81]. The high throughput of DFC (hundreds of cells per second)
means it is one of the few biomechanical techniques found in the clinic
where it is used for cell phenotyping. The high stresses applied to cells,
however, means that the viscosity value calculated from DFC is not neces
sarily comparable to that which may be found by other techniques.
Both MA and DFC are typically applied to suspension cells, as are op
tical trapping (OT) deformation techniques and optical stretching (OS).
15


2.1. SINGLE-CELL BIOMECHANICS
Optical trapping techniques include use of beads adhered to the cell as
“handles” which can be optically trapped, while optical stretching uses the
forces applied to a cell by light in order to deform it. The magnitudes of
stress applied, however, is very different to DFC or MA, with the optical
techniques applying stresses on the order of a few Pascals[49]. As a result,
both OT and OS probe mechanical properties closer to the unperturbed
state of the cell, avoiding effects of rejuvenation caused by large strains.
The optical stretcher can measure a cell in around a second, making it
suitable for cell-population studies; this revealed the correlation between
cancer cell deformability and malignancy (i.e. malignant cells are more
deformable)[59]. Optical trapping measurements take longer (seconds to
minutes per cell), but have demonstrated the importance of pre-stress and
deformation history for suspension cells[72] and elucidated the mechanical
properties of red blood cells in sickle cell anaemia[8] and malaria[9].
2.1.1.2 Point-Contact Measurements
Other techniques listed in Table 2.2 are mostly applied to adherent cells.
While study of suspension cells allows for higher throughput and clinical
applications, adherent cells are more widely studied. One common method
is to use an external probe, such as a bead adhered to the cell, both for
applying forces to the cell and tracking the resultant deformation.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is often lauded as the gold standard for
biomechanical measurements of adherent cells because it directly measures
Young’s modulus[82, 83]. However the measurement can be influenced by
to the tip geometry, the indentation depth and speed[84]. Furthermore,
force-indentation curves necessitate use of preconceived models to fit data;
commonly used are standard linear models comprising elastic springs and
16


2.1. SINGLE-CELL BIOMECHANICS
viscous dashpots.
AFM is limited to studying the apical surface of cells but has revealed a con
nection between mechanical and electrical activity of nerve cells[85] as well
as finding numerous application in the study of cancer cell mechanics[86].
Force-indentation curves are commonly analysed using standard linear mod
els, however they may also be analysed using the soft glassy rheology or
the poroelastic model[87]. The poroelastic model and its implications for
microrheology are discussed in more detail in Section 2.2.4.
Magnetic twisting cytometry (MTC) has been one of the driving forces in
understanding the glassy (slow-relaxing) nature of cell viscoelasticity[50],
and key to this is the soft glassy model of cell rheology[88]. Applying a
torque to a magnetic bead adhered to the cell surface, MTC measures the
shear modulus of the cell via the bead lateral displacement. It has been ap
plied at length to study non-linear relaxation of cells, including rejuvenation
and the role that macromolecular crowding plays in cell mechanics[89–91],
as well as the role of cytoskeletal remodelling in the abnormal behaviour of
airway smooth muscle cells in asthma[89, 92]. The rejuvenation (recovery of
unperturbed mechanical properties after deformation) of cells was revealed
to follow a power-law form, also indicative of glassy rheology[88, 90].
Magnetic bead microrheometry (MBM) is conceptually similar to MTC,
applying a pulling force instead of a torque, and allows for much larger
force magnitudes (nN instead of pN)[69]. This may alter the compliance
of the cell, which exhibits viscoelastic response with a relaxation time of
∼0.1 s and a viscous response at long times, both well described by a sin
gle standard linear model[48]. By using both magnetic and non-magnetic
beads, MBM can be used to study the propagation of stress across a cell
as any deflection of the non-magnetic bead is caused by cellular strain.
17


2.1. SINGLE-CELL BIOMECHANICS
Such experiments revealed that the viscoelastic screening length varies be
tween different cell lines with 3T3 fibroblasts having a screening length
of around 7 ➭m and J774 macrophages exhibiting no induced deflections of
non-magnetic beads[48, 69]. This suggests that the true length scale probed
by biomechanical measurements depends on the viscoelastic properties and
possibly cytoskeletal organisation of the cell under study.
2.1.1.3 Acoustic Measurements
The remaining active measurement techniques all utilise acoustic waves on
some level. Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) is the microscopic ana
logue of a clinical ultrasound scanner, using a piezo transducer to generate
and detect acoustic waves. Applications to single-cell study are few because
the resolution is limited by the frequencies achievable by piezo transducers,
however it should have excellent biocompatibility due to the low frequen
cies of the acoustic waves. Despite having low resolution it has been used
to demonstrate differences in the speed and attenuation of sound waves
between benign and malignant tissues[66].
Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) uses a pulsed laser to generate a sound
wave by localised heating, and a piezo transducer to measure the wave out
side of the sample. Again, resolution is limited by the acoustic wavelength
probed making it ill suited to single-cell applications, however the gener
ation method allows for in vivo study of small animals[65]. While SAM
directly measures acoustic parameters at MHz frequencies, PAM actually
measures the optical absorption coefficient which is a quasi-static property
of the sample.
Low resolution is a barrier to sub-cellular study for all-acoustic techniques
such as SAM, PAM and acoustic micrometers. To perform acoustic mea
18


2.1. SINGLE-CELL BIOMECHANICS
surements at higher frequencies, generation and detection of ultrasound
needs technologies other than piezo transducers. Phonon microscopy (PM,
Chapter 5) uses a femtosecond pulsed laser and a multilayer opto-acoustic
transducer to launch a coherent acoustic pulse into a cell, where it can be
interrogated by a second laser pulse[93]. This allows axial resolution of
a few hundred nanometres, however the acoustic pulse attenuates quickly
and measurements are limited to within a few microns of the basal plane
of the cell. It has provided insight into the mechanical behaviour of Acan
thamoeba Castellanii during the encystation process that makes the single
celled organism so robust[94]. Further applications of PM have been limited
so far by biocompatibility, however in this work I demonstrate protracted
measurements of single live mamallian cells without killing them.
Stimulated Brillouin scattering (StBS) uses the interference pattern from
two counter-propagating lasers to generate a sound wave via electrostriction
and probe it by Brillouin scattering, achieving a resolution limited by the
optical system. Applications thus far have been limited by high optical
powers required due to the non-linear scaling of scattered light intensity
and peak power[95], however recent advances using pulsed lasers to increase
peak power while reducing average power have allowed for StBS study of
single mammalian cells[68]. Even still, biological applications of stimulated
Brillouin scattering are in their infancy.
2.1.2 Passive Techniques
Passive measurements of cell mechanics, listed in Table 2.1, occur at lower
stresses and strain rates than active measurements. As a result, cellular
prestress is lower but cells appear stiffer and more solid as they are not
subject to fluidisation due to lower strains; additionally techniques based
19


2.1. SINGLE-CELL BIOMECHANICS
upon passive microrheology also allow study of the active force generation
within cells. Thus passive measurement techniques have the potential to
reveal insights which are not accessible to active techniques. Additionally, a
variety of different probes may be used, including synthetic micronspheres,
sound waves, and fluorescent molecules, each probing different length-scales
and quantities. Included in Table 2.1 is external passive microrheology
(EPM), which is discussed in the context of the field in Section 2.4.
At the scale of molecules, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
probes cellular viscosity by photobleaching a spot within the cell and then
monitoring the fluorescence intensity recovering as fluorophores diffuse into
the bleached spot[76, 96]. Diffusion for particles smaller than the mesh size
(hundreds of nanometres) is less hampered by macromolecular crowding
and FRAP reports a nanoscale viscosity 20× lower than the microscale
viscosity[96]. This should be interpreted carefully, however, as the dif
fusivity measured may not be directly related to the viscosity. That is,
the Stokes-Einstein relation (η ∝ 1/D) may not hold true; in fact, cel
lular activity can increase the diffusivity of fluorophores[97]. While the
phenomenon is not well understood, a possible explanation is that it is ad
vantageous to the cell to have non-specific transport faster than diffusion
alone would achieve.
Each of the techniques mentioned thus far have probed cellular compli
ance, be it viscosity or elasticity, however the force generation of cells is
also of interest. Techniques such as traction force microscopy (TFM) and
elastic resonator interference stress microscopy (ERISM) can measure the
transverse and normal components, respectively, of the stress tensor at the
cell surface. Each measures deformations of an elastic layer below the cell,
limiting the time scale probed to the relaxation time of the elastic layer,
typically on the order of a second. These techniques can quantify both
20


2.1. SINGLE-CELL BIOMECHANICS
intercellular forces, with TFM finding forces of up to 200nN[98], and cell
substrate forces, with ERISM resolving the relation between fluctuations
in the force applied by migrating cells and their speed[74, 99]. TFM can
also measure the time evolution of the strain energy within cells, show
ing differences in force-time and strain energy-time response to contractile
agonists[100], demonstrating the variability in cellular mechanical response
to different chemical signals.
2.1.2.1 Passive Microrheology Techniques
Endogenous tracer microrheology (ETM) is the simplest cell microrheol
ogy experiment, in which motion of endogenous particles is tracked and
analysed[23]. While the fluctuations of single particles can reveal the shear
modulus of its milieu, correlations between nearby particles can reveal both
the active stress fluctuation spectrum of the cytoskeleton and the shear
modulus of the unperturbed cytoplasm (recall that colloidal particles alter
the rheology of their surroundings, Section 2.2.4). This was able to con
firm that the soft glassy rheology model can be applied to the cytoplasm
as well as giving the first insight into the frequency distribution of cells’
active stress fluctuations. Despite its simplicity, ETM has not found a
wealth of applications due to its non-specificity: different subcellular com
ponents exhibit different diffusive behaviours, determined by their specific
interactions and transport mechanisms.
Overcoming the problems presented by use of endogenous probes, ballistic
injection nanorheology (BIN) uses compressed gas to fire probes into the
cell. Again single probes can be studied as can the correlations between
multiple probes. This enables study of more varied cellular systems and
BIN has revealed cell stiffness in both 2D and 3D cultures[101, 102] as well
21


2.1. SINGLE-CELL BIOMECHANICS
as revealing the role of the Rho signalling pathway in cellular response to
shear flow[102].
To perform widefield particle tracking experiments, a fast camera is re
quired, limiting the shortest timescale which can be probed. For single
particle tracking experiments, laser interferometry with a quadrant pho
todiode at the back focal plane can be used to achieve higher temporal
resolution; this comes at the cost of only being able to track particle po
sition if it is within ∼ 200[nm] of the probe laser focus. To overcome
this, feedback tracking microrheology (FTM) uses the position of probe
particle to guide stage movements, hence keeping the probe within the
linear response region of the quadrant photodiode[? ]. Reporting over a
wider frequency range than any other cell microrheology technique, FTM
has demonstrated that soft glassy rheology is inherent to the cytosol and
increases with macromolecular crowding[103? ].
2.1.2.2 Spontaneous Brillouin Scattering
Microrheology experiments probe a length scale which is determined by
the size of the probe particle, typically on the order of microns. Scaling
down, thermally generated acoustic phonons with wavelengths of hundreds
of nanometres can be probed by spontaneous Brillouin microscopy (SpBM).
This allows for measurement of longitudinal viscosity and elasticity at the
Brillouin frequency, typically GHz, where cells and even water are pre
dominantly elastic (i.e. M ′′(νB) ≫ M ′(νB)). The length scale probed by
Brillouin-scattering techniques is determined by the largest of the optical
point spread function and the acoustic mode being probed; while higher
numerical aperture lenses would increase the resolution of Brillouin scat
tering, it would also result in spectral broadening for StBS and SpBM[104]
22


2.2. RHEOLOGY
and increased attenuation of phonon microscopy signals[67].
Brillouin scattering for single cell study is still in its infancy however recent
advances in instrumentation have enabled a range of applications. A key
challenge to studying biological samples, especially tissues, is isolating the
Brillouin scattered light from the Rayleigh line, typically achieved with
notch filters. As a non-invasive all-optical technique it is possible to make
in vivo measurements such as studying the formation of the gastrointestinal
tract in Drosophila embryos[105]. Studies on spinal cord repair in zebrafish
have not only shown that an injury is accompanied by tissue stiffening, but
also that excising tissues alters their mechanical properties, making it all
the more important to develop in vivo biomechanical techniques[106].
The role of heterogeneity and interpretation of Brillouin frequency from
biological specimens is a subject of contemporary debate in the bioBrillouin
community, with some claiming Brillouin scattering merely probes water
content[107]. Studying the dehydration of gelatine gels[108] enabled Bailey
et. al. to disprove this, showing that Brillouin scattering probes stress
relaxation and demonstrating a glassy transition at low hydration.
2.2 Rheology
Rheology, from Greek “rheos”, meaning flow, is the study of deformations
and flows of matter. Rheology experiments involve measuring the strain (in
1D this is change in length over original length ε = ∆x/x), and the stress,
or force per unit cross-sectional area σ = F/A. This is commonly either
measuring the time-dependent strain, ε(t) = x(t)/x0, within a sample in
response to a step stress, σ0; or measuring the time-dependent stress, σ(t),
in response to a time-varying strain, ε(t). In the latter case, analysis is

Figure 2.2: a) Bulk modulus determines material response to an isotropic stress. b) Shear modulus for “slippage” type deformations. c) Poisson’s ratio, ν, describes compressibility of a material. d) Young’s modulus determines response to uniaxial stress with unconstrained lateral dimension. e) Longitudinal modulus determines response to uniaxial stress with zero lateral strain.
typically carried out in the frequency domain.
Materials’ response to deformations are often described in terms of the
shear modulus, G, the Young’s modulus, E , and Poisson’s ratio, ν. Other
common quantities are bulk modulus, K, and longitudinal modulus, M.
For the case of an isotropic material, any two of these are adequate to fully
describe any deformation. Figure 2.2 shows deformations which depend
only on one of the moduli. Having demonstrated these four moduli, I will
continue this section concerning myself only with the shear modulus as it is
the modulus probed by microrheology, although much of the below theory
can equally be applied to any of these moduli.
24


2.2. RHEOLOGY
2.2.1 Constitutive Relations
The relation between stress, σ, and strain, ε, for a step-stress or an oscilla
tory strain can respectively be summarised by the relations:
ε(t) = σ0J(t),
σˆ(ω) = εˆ(ω)G∗(ω)
(2.1)
with shear creep compliance, J(t), defining the time-dependent relation and
the complex shear modulus, G∗(ω), describing the frequency-dependent
relation between stress and strain. In the more general case
Material response can equivalently be expressed in the frequency domain
as complex modulus, G∗(ω), or in the time domain as creep compliance,
J(t), or shear relaxation modulus, G(t). These equivalent quantities are
related by [109]

∗(ω) = G′(ω) + iG′′(ω), (2.5)
with imaginary unit i = √−1, time t, lag time τ , and angular frequency
ω = f/2π. Clearly the modulus and the compliance are inverse - a stiffer
material has higher modulus and lower compliance. The complex modulus
has a real part, the elastic (or storage) modulus G′, and an imaginary part,
the viscous (or loss) modulus G′′.
Using the complex modulus to describe a material response has the primary
advantage that the elastic and viscous components can be easily separated

Note that while the model materials here have frequency-independent elas
ticity (a and c) and viscosity linear with frequency (b and c), viscoelastic
materials may exhibit power-law behaviours for both. Furthermore, many
materials exhibit a non-linear response for strain with increasing stress.
Despite this, linear viscoelastic theory is relevant in this thesis as it forms
the basis for microrheology theory and the Generalised Stokes-Einstein Re
26


2.2. RHEOLOGY
lation. The measurements performed here using passive microrheology and
phonon microscopy are within the low strain regime, where living cells can
be considered linear viscoelastic materials.
2.2.2 Microrheology
Particle tracking microrheology arguably began with Robert Brown’s ex
periments observing pollen diffusing on the surface of water; these exper
iments lead to the discovery of Brownian motion. Before this, Fick was
the first to predict the mean squared displacement (MSD) of a particle
undergoing free diffusion[110],
M SD = 〈∆r2(τ )〉 = 〈(r(t) − r(t + τ ))2〉
t = 2nDτ, (2.9)
where n is the number of dimensions the particle is diffusing in, τ is known
as the lag time, with particle position r(t) at time t and the time average
denoted by ⟨⟩t. (Strictly this would be an average over the independent
observations of the displacement for a given lag time, i.e.: t = mτ for
integer m, but using all values of t gives better SNR[111].)
To understand Brownian motion, we consider the forces acting upon a
particle, via the Langevin equation:
ma⃗ (t) = ⃗fG(t) +
∫t
0
v⃗ (τ )ζ(t − τ )dτ (2.10)
where a particle of mass m has instantaneous accelerationa⃗ driven by a
random (Gaussian) noise ⃗fG(t) and damped by the integral term. The
integrand consists of the particle velocityv⃗ (τ ) and a microscopic memory
function, ζ(t − τ ), representing viscous drag in the suspension fluid.
27


2.2. RHEOLOGY
Starting with the Langevin equation, Mason and Weitz[112] bridged the
gap between microscopic behaviour and macroscopic properties. They note
that the microscopic memory function, ζ(t) in Equation 2.10 is related to
the velocity autocorrelation function by the correlations in the driving force
fG. For over-damped motion the velocity autocorrelation function can be
used to determine the MSD. This can be seen by first recognising that
the MSD is related to the position (x) autocorrelation function ⟨x(t0 +
τ )x(t0)⟩t0:
M SD(τ ) = 2 (⟨r2⟩ − ⟨x(t0 + τ ) x(t0)⟩t0
) ; (2.11)
and then considering that for over-damped motion the mean force, velocity
and displacement for a given time interval are all proportional. Thus the
bulk viscosity of the fluid in Laplace space, η ̃(s) with Laplace frequency s,
relates to the microscopic memory function by a constant of proportionality
ζ ̃(s) = 6πaη ̃(s), (2.12)
depending only on the particle radius, a. Thus the Laplace transformed
MSD, ⟨∆r ̃2(s)⟩, is related to the Laplace transformed shear relaxation mod
ulus
G ̃(s) = sη ̃(s) = s
6πa
[ 6kBT
s2⟨∆r ̃2(s)⟩ − ms
]
, (2.13)
where G ̃(s) is the Laplace transform of the gradient of the relaxation mod
ulus Gr(t), also known as the relaxation spectrum. The ms term which
represents particle inertia can be neglected at frequencies much less than
the reciprocal of the velocity relaxation time of the particle. For typical
microrheology experimental conditions, the frequency where particle iner
tia becomes relevant is on the order of MHz. By analytical continuation
between the Fourier and Laplace domains, a simplified form can be written

in terms of the complex modulus:

This is known to microrheologists as the generalised Stokes-Einstein rela
tion (GSER) and is seminal in the study of diffusion to understand the
mechanics of viscoelastic materials. Interpretation of the MSD is further
aided by the equivalence of MSD and creep compliance in a step-stress
experiment[113].
J(τ ) = πa

Further work has examined the circumstances under which assumptions
behind the GSER are valid, which is discussed in Section 2.2.4.
The analyses above were first applied to Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy[112],
a microrheological technique where the autocorrelation of multiply scat
tered light probes the MSD of an ensemble of probe particles. Mason later
extended the analyses to particle tracking microrheology[114], measuring
displacements of a probe particle via forward-scattered laser light. Later,
particle tracking microrheology using widefield microscopy was demon
strated with video cameras. Modern cameras make this trivial with high
speeds, high resolutions, high bit-depths and dynamic ranges, and digital
data streamed directly to a PC for storage or analysis.
Figure 2.4 demonstrates optical trapping video microrheology of water us
ing an optically trapped polystyrene microsphere (typical image shown in
set to d). The strong intensity gradient near the focus confines the diffusion
of the bead ensuring the bead remains in the field of view and allowing it
to be recorded over many minutes. Optical trapping is commonly used
in microrheology when looking at solutions or weak gels where the bead
would otherwise diffuse out of the field of view before sufficient data is
29


2.2. RHEOLOGY
recorded[115]. Measurements of 200,000 images each were taken on the
same bead using increasing laser powers to increase the trap stiffness κ =
0.12pN/μm, 0.51pN/μm, and 1.4pN/μm for black, blue and red respec
tively. At short times (shown in b) the bead diffuses freely, unaffected
by the trap, and Brownian motion is observed giving MSD ∝ Dτ in c)
and G′′ ≫ G′ in d). At times much greater than the trap relaxation time
(shown in c), the bead is confined within the trap and subdiffuse motion is
observed, giving constant MSD ∝ κ−1 and G′′ ≪ G′′. More detail on the
data processing shown is in Chapter 3.

2.2.3 Numerical Methods
Figure 2.5 summarises approaches used described within the text to use
particle tracking data in order to understand the particle’s motion. These
are primarily to quantify the viscoelasticity of the material being probed.
The methods to quantify trap stiffness in optical trapping can be gener
alised to any elastic confinement. Agnostic data analyses fall outside of
the generalised Stokes-Einstein relation, where particle motion may not be
indicative of the viscoelasticity.
The numerical inversion of time-domain particle tracking data to the fre
quency domain is, in general, non-trivial. This is because the Fourier trans
form integral,
⟨∆rˆ2(ω)⟩ =
∫∞
−∞
⟨∆r2(τ )⟩eiωτ dτ, (2.16)
does not converge as the MSD ⟨∆r2(τ )⟩ does not tend to zero at long times.
32


2.2. RHEOLOGY
There are several methods to overcome this which I have implemented and
compared however the following method produces the lowest errors over a
wide range of frequencies[116].
Evans et. al.[109] developed a technique to perform the inversion with
minimal numerical errors by considering the experimental MSD as a piece
wise function consisting of the discrete observations connected by linear
sections. Thus the gradient of the MSD is a discontinuous series of piece
wise functions, and the second derivative of the MSD is a series of delta
functions. By analytically finding the Fourier transform of this series of
delta functions, Evans arrives at the following: for a function gk discretely
sampled at times tk for k = 1, ...N , the Fourier transform gˆ(ω) obeys
−ω2gˆ(ω) =iωg(0) + (1 − e−iωt1) g1 − g(0)

(2.17)
where g(0) is the value of g extrapolated to t = 0 from above, and ginf ty
is the gradient of g extrapolated to infinite time. More details of my im
plementation of the rheological Fourier transform are in Section 3.3.3, in
cluding considerations of data processing to improve SNR. In implementing
Equation 2.17, the recommendations of Tassieri et. al.[117] were followed
including data interpolation.
There exist other methods for performing the above numerical inversion[118].
Particularly noteworthy is Yanagishima’s[119] real-time method for cal
culating rheological moduli during particle tracking experiments. Other
methods, however, give higher errors on the resulting viscoelastic modulus[116].
33


2.2. RHEOLOGY
2.2.4 Mechanics Beyond LVE and GSER
So far, discussion has considered situations where the sample viscoelastic
properties probed by microrheology are the same as would be probed by
bulk rheology. The systems have been assumed to be ergodic, meaning
an average over an ensemble of particles will yield the same result as an
average for one particle over a span of time. This is the case for simple
fluids such as water or glycerol, but not for colloidal systems such as found
inside living cells and tissues[120].
In many colloidal systems, a characteristic length scale known as the mesh
size can be defined or empirically determined. The diffusion of a particle
then depends on its size relative to the mesh size. A larger particle will
probe the colloidal ensemble in the same way bulk rheology would, while
a smaller particle will undergo caged diffusion, probing the viscosity of the
interstitial fluid. In such cases, the asymptotic behaviours of the system
can be described as nanoscale and microscale viscosities[96]. The nanoscale
viscosity will determine the diffusive transport of small molecules within
the cell, while the diffusion of macromolecules as well as stress relaxation
in the cytoplasm depend on the microscale viscosity.
Consider now a single probe particle suspended within a model complex
fluid, consisting of an elastic network embedded in an incompressible vis
cous fluid. This is the poroelastic model for cells, in which we consider the
stress both within the elastic network and the viscous suspension medium.
The response function (displacement for a given applied force) of the probe
particle provides insights into what microrheology is probing[121]. Within
this model several effects cause one particle microrheology measurements
to depart from bulk rheology[121–124].
34


2.2. RHEOLOGY
Figure 2.6: Poroelastic model in which the one particle microrheology response function differs from the shear modulus probed by bulk rheology. a) At frequencies above a cut-off, ωc, or equivalently for strain wavelengths below a cut-off λc, viscous stress (red) remains within the interstitial fluid when the complex fluid undergoes deformation. At frequencies below the cut-off, the fluid drains through the network and the viscous stress is uniform. b) Perturbations to fluid (shown as darker colour) by probe particle, causing radial concentration gradient of elastic elements. Figures made to demonstrate key findings from [121, 122].
At low frequencies the model exhibits a lock-in, or cut-off, frequency (termed
ωc), below which the fluid can drain freely while the elastic network under
goes longitudinal deformations. See Figure 2.6a for visualisation. Thus, at
low frequencies, microrheology probes the longitudinal modes of the elastic
network. At intermediate frequencies the GSER is found to hold true only
if the bead size is much larger than the mesh size of the elastic network, and
at high frequencies fluid inertial effects influence the response of the bead.
For a 1μm bead in a 2 mg/ml actin solution, the intermediate frequency
range is 1 MHz > ω > 10 Hz[124].
Furthermore, the presence of probe particles causes local perturbations to
the complex fluid[125]. The elastic network is displaced, leading to a con
centration gradient in the milieu of the probe particle (shown in Figure
2.6b). Surface chemistry of both the probe particle and the elastic network
will affect the perturbation and hence the Brownian motion of the probe.
Hence, one-particle microrheology only probes the perturbed fluid, not the
“bulk phase”; and changing the probe coating will give different apparent
35


2.2. RHEOLOGY
mechanical properties. Studying the correlation between displacements
of nearby particles overcomes the local perturbations and inherent inho
mogeneities, hence achieving better agreement with the bulk mechanical
properties of complex fluids [125, 126].
2.2.5 Cell Rheology
Considering how the response function for a single particle is affected by
both the mesh size and “free draining” modes, the length and time scale
over which a measurement probes cell mechanics can be seen to affect
the result. High strains (more than a few percent) such as found in de
formability flow cytometry and magnetic bead microrheometry, cause cell
fluidisation[64]. Thus these techniques are expected to report cells being
softer than if they were measured with techniques such as external passive
microrheology or intracellular microrheology.
In addition to fluidisation, live adherent cells exhibit aging effects known as
rejuvenation whereby cell stiffness is reduced after deformation and recovers
slowly following a power-law behaviour[64, 90]. Time-evolving mechanical
properties leads to non-ergodicity, meaning a particle tracking experiment
considering the ensemble average will yield different results to one consid
ering the time average of a single particle[120]. The strain fluctuations
present in living cells may also cause the system to be non-ergodic, and the
implications for this in the measurements made are discussed in Chapters
4 and 5.

2.3. LIGHT SCATTERING
2.3 Light Scattering
Light scattering is an interaction between light and matter which changes
the direction of the propagating light, broadly categorised as either elastic
or inelastic. In this thesis, elastic light scattering is used to apply forces in
optical trapping (Chapters 3 and 4), enabling microrheology measurements
of G∗ in water and of live cells. Inelastic scattering is used to probe acoustic
fields in phonon microscopy (Chapter 5), allowing measurements of M ′ in
live cells.
Elastic scattering does not change the wavelength of the scattered light
(except possible Doppler shift for moving scatterers). Two types of elas
tic light scattering are particularly important for optical trapping, namely
Rayleigh and Mie scattering[127]. These are explained in Section 2.3.1.
To contrast, inelastic light scattering is an interaction where both the di
rection and wavelength of the incident light may change. Two inelastic
light scattering techniques used for study of biological specimens are Ra
man scattering and Brillouin (or Brillouin-Mandelstam) scattering which
are explained in Section 2.3.2.
2.3.1 Elastic Scattering
Rayleigh scattering arises when light interacts with a dielectric particle
much smaller than the optical wavelength. Considering a dielectric sphere
such a polystyrene microsphere, Rayleigh scattering arises from the dipole
induced within the particle by the incident electric field[128]. The scattered
field intensity as a function of angle and distance to particle, Is(θ, R) can
37


2.3. LIGHT SCATTERING
be calculated as
Is(θ, R) = I0
1 + cos2 θ 2R2
( 2π λ
)4 ( m2 − 1
m2 + 2
)2
a6, (2.18)
where m = np/nm is the ratio of refractive index of the particle to that of
the medium, a is the radius of the particle, and λ the optical wavelength.
Mie scattering, on the other hand, applies to particles with sizes compa
rable to the wavelength, and has a scattering spectrum determined by the
particle size and dielectric properties[128]. Calculation of Mie scattering
is beyond the scope of this thesis, however its application is essential to
optical trapping of micron-sized spheres. Considering polystyrene spheres
illuminated by a monochromatic source, the angular dependence of the
scattered light depends on the ratio 2πd/λ, with larger particles scattering a
greater proportion of the light in the forward direction, leading to weaker
scattering forces.
2.3.1.1 Optical Trapping
The gradient force optical trap was first proposed by Arthur Ashkin in
1986[129] while researching radiation forces on the micro-scale. Hereafter
when I refer to an optical trap, I mean gradient force optical trap unless
otherwise stated. Optical trapping has found extensive applications in life
sciences and microrheology, for example as a force transducer[8, 127, 130]
and to control the position of cells or particles[131–133]. When charac
terising weak gels or viscous fluids, optical trapping prevents the probe
particle from diffusing out of the field of view, allowing faster and longer
measurements[115].
An optical trap can be as simple as a tightly focussed laser beam. In mi
38


2.3. LIGHT SCATTERING
croscopy this is commonly achieved using a high numerical aperture (NA)
objective lens, and a continuous wave laser beam collimated at the back
focal plane. Overfilling the back focal plane increases the laser power inci
dent at high spatial frequencies which increases the trapping efficiency. To
achieve the high NA needed, water or oil immersion objectives are com
monplace. A detailed description of how a focussed laser beam exerts a
force is in Section 2.3.1.2
In optical trapping, laser powers from a few milliwatts up to hundreds of
milliwatts at the sample[134] may be used. The powers used in Chapter 4
are typically less than thirty milliwatts, and exposure to cells is minimal
because the trapping laser is turned off for most of the experiment. Despite
this, it is worth considering damage to the cells under study. When study
ing delicate biological systems, damage to the sample is avoided by reduc
tion of laser power and careful selection of wavelength, using a “therapeutic
window of transparency” in the near-infrared (∼700 nm - 1200 nm)[127], be
tween absorption bands from proteins in the visible range and from water
in the far infra-red. Thus using Nd:YAG trapping lasers at 1064 nm (as I
do here) is a common way to avoid unnecessary heating or damage to one’s
sample, and it has previously been shown that optically trapping T-cells
with tens of milliwatts of laser power at 1064 nm for up to an hour has no
significant effect on their viability[133].
2.3.1.2 Optical Trapping Forces
The forces applied in optical trapping are generally described as a gradient
force and a scattering force, and while these can be rigourously calculated
for special cases such as the Rayleigh scattering regime or for weakly fo
cussed beams (beam waist w0 ≫ λ), they are in general difficult to derive
39


2.3. LIGHT SCATTERING
for micron-sized particles in a tightly focussed beam[127, 135]. Here I will
introduce approximations for the trapping forces in the Rayleigh regime,
neglecting a full derivation or application of Mie scattering theory as it is
beyond the scope of the thesis. The Rayleigh regime is quantitively differ
ent to the Mie regime, however gradient and scattering forces arise in both
so individual trapped particles behave in a qualitatively similar manner for
either regime.
The gradient force arises from the effect of an electric field on the induced
dipole of the trapped particle. In the general case of a point dipole within
an electromagnetic field, the instantaneous force can be written as
⃗F = p(⃗ · ∇) ⃗E +p⃗  ̇ × ⃗B +r⃗  ̇ × p(⃗ · ∇) ⃗B, (2.19)
wherep⃗ is the dipole moment, ∇ the gradient operator. Here the electric
( ⃗E) and magnetic ( ⃗B) fields are assumed to be unperturbed by the particle.
The first and last terms of Equation 2.19 account for the spatial inhomo
geneity of the electric field while the second term comes from the magnetic
Lorentz force.
Clearly the total force depends strongly on the spatial distribution of the
electromagnetic field, and in the case of a weakly focussed Gaussian beam
(such that the zeroth order paraxial Gaussian beam approximation is valid)
the gradient force for a small displacement of the particle in the +x direc
tion can be written as[135]
⃗Fg = − xˆ 2πnma3

, (2.20)
which (for small displacements) scales linearly with the beam power P and
40


2.3. LIGHT SCATTERING
distance from trap centre x. Here nm and np are the refractive indices of
the medium and particle, m is the ratio = np/nm, a is the particle radius,
w0 is the beam waist, and x and z are the radial and axial co-ordinates
respectively.
Note that the direction of the gradient force is opposite to that of the
displacement, enabling us to draw analogy to a Hookean spring, or ideal
elastic element. Writing the stiffness κ = ∂Fg/∂x|x=0, the complex modulus
for an optically trapped bead in water can be written simply as
G
∗(ω) = κ/6πa + i6πaηwω, (2.21)
where a is the bead radius and ηw is the dynamic viscosity of water. Note
that this is the same as the Kelvin-Voigt model solid in Equation 2.8 with
G
′ = κ/6πa and G′′ = 6πaηwω.
The scattering force for the same particle can also be derived, and takes
the form
⃗Fs =zˆnm

[ 2x2

]
, (2.22)
where I have introduced the wavenumber k = nmω/c.
To form a stable optical trap, the gradient force must be dominant, ex
ceeding both the scattering force and the thermal energy of the particle
(∼ kBT ). To aid in assessing this, it is helpful to consider the potential
well that arises from the gradient force which can be written
Ug = 2πnma3
c

41


2.3. LIGHT SCATTERING
using beam power P , refractive indices nm and np of the medium and
particle, m is the ratio = np/nm, a is the particle radius and w0 is the beam
waist.
In practical terms, the stability of the trap is ensured by using a tightly
focussed beam from a high numerical aperture objective lens to create a
strong gradient force in the z direction such that Fs,z < Fg,z. The approx
imations used to derive the prior equations thus do not strictly hold true
as the approximations assume a meak focus. They do, however, serve to
demonstrate how optical trapping forces arise and what is required for a
stable optical trap.
2.3.2 Inelastic Scattering
Inelastic scattering may be used to probe high frequency vibrations within
biological samples. In Brillouin scattering, acoustic phonons typically at
GHz frequencies can be used to measure the longitudinal modulus of a
sample. Raman scattering probes optical phonons with THz frequencies to
determine the chemical composition of a sample. In each, photons of light
interact with phonons in the sample and may be re-radiated with longer
wavelength (Stokes’ shift) or shorter (anti-Stokes’ shift). The frequency
shift of the scattered light is commonly analysed using a spectrometer.
The first experimental observations were published by Brillouin in 1922[136]
and Mandelstam in 1926[137]. Acoustic phonons, the result of inhomo
geneities (e.g. density fluctuations) within a material, may be of thermal
origin (i.e. spontaneous Brillouin scattering), or generated in a coherent
manner such as in Phonon microscopy or stimulated Brillouin scattering.
Raman scattering is the result of the interaction between photons and
42


2.3. LIGHT SCATTERING
the internal vibrations of a molecule[138]. The first published experimen
tal measurements of Raman scattering were by Raman and Krishnan in
1928[139], although Landsberg and Mandelstam also published measure
ments of the same in 1928[140] along with a more complete theoretical
explanation for their measurements. Thus while Raman was awarded the
Nobel Prize in 1930, the technique was commonly referred to as
“combinatory scattering” within the Soviet Union[138].
2.3.2.1 Brillouin Scattering
Consider a photon incident upon a phonon, whilst maintaining generality
in 2D as shown in Figure 2.7a. The phonon acts like a Bragg grating (via
the photo-elastic effect); that is to say a periodic variation in the optical
properties which gives strong reflectance at certain angles via constructive
interference. For incident photon wavelength λk1 and material refractive in
dex n, the Bragg reflection condition requires incident phonon wavelengths
λq1 which satisfy
2λq1 cos
(θ
2
)
= λk1
n , (2.24)
where θ
2 is the incidence angle, or half the angle between the incident and
scattered photon wavevectors. The cosine term arises from the geometry
of the incident wavevectors (shown in Figure 2.7a).
An inelastic scattering event gives rise to either a Stokes shift in the case
of the photon losing momentum to a phonon or an anti-Stokes shift in the
case of a photon gaining momentum from a phonon. For Stokes scattered
light, the wavevectors may be drawn as in Figure 2.7. Consider first the
wavevectors of the two interacting particles, followed by the frequency shift
43


2.3. LIGHT SCATTERING

Incident wavevectors are shown as solid lines, and scattered wavevectors are shown as dotted lines. Basis vectors used in the text are defined in (a), thus a wavevector with wavenumber |k| at an arbitrary angle φ from the incident photon can be written

where the final equality demonstrates that the x component of the incident

relations written thus far can be derived from simple geometric arguments
when considering Figure 2.7a.

where V is the speed of sound, determined by square root of the ratio of

wavelength for the incident photon (vacuum) wavelength and refractive
index n using Equation 2.24. Note that the scattered and incident optical
44


2.4. CONTEXT OF THIS WORK
wavelengths, respectively, are related by
λk2 = λk1 ± c
νB
, (2.28)
so to a first-order approximation λk2 = λk1 as νB ≪ c
λk1 (GHz shifts applied
to THz optical frequencies). Here the ± arises from the possibility of Stokes
or anti-Stokes scattering events.
A key difference between phonon microscopy (and other time-resolved Bril
louin scattering techniques, discussed later in Section 5.2.2) and stimulated
Brillouin scattering (and most Brillouin scattering techniques) is the acous
tic wavenumber probed. For spontaneous Brillouin the acoustic wavenum
ber is half the optical wavenumber (Equation 2.24). This is not the case
for phonon microscopy as the acoustic pulse generated is much shorter
(∼80 nm) than the optical wavelength (780 nm), and the scattering interac
tion is dominated by the higher wavenumber Fourier components. Because
the interaction length, la, is shorter than the acoustic wavelength PLU
based techniques theoretically probe optoacoustic properties with higher
axial resolution than a spontaneous Brillouin scattering experiment. In
practice, signal processing limits the axial resolution of phonon microscopy
to ∼780 nm, while the optical point-spread function limits spontaneous
Brillouin microscopy to ∼2 ➭m.
2.4 Context of this work
Decades of study into mechanobiology have revealed that both the elastic
properties of cells, and the forces they generate bear studying in order to
understand behaviour of single cells. Techniques such as magnetic twisting
cytometry and magnetic bead microrheometry exist which can probe the
45


2.4. CONTEXT OF THIS WORK
complex shear modulus of single cells, and the strain due to forces generated
within the cell[64, 141], however they cannot make these measurements
simultaneously. Additionally these active techniques cause fluidisation and
rejuvenation which lead changes in the cell mecahanical properties. Passive
techniques such as endogenous tracer microrheology or ballistic injection
nanorheology can measure the shear modulus, but are either non-specific
or invasive.
Studies using beads adhered to cells using liands which target different
receptors, such as integrin or scavenger receptors, have shown that the
apparent shear modulus of cells depends on the adhesion target[44]. Despite
this, few techniques have studied the time evolution of the mechanics of the
binding site, instead choosing to allow cells to reach an equilibrium before
starting measurements[50, 64, 69, 90].
In Chapter 4 I demonstrate that by using optical trapping to control the
location on the cell surface that a microsphere is bound, and high spa
tiotemporal resolution video microscopy to perform particle tracking, ex
ternal passive microrheology can simultaneously determine both the com
plex shear modulus and the stress generation of individual live cells. This
is applied to probe the initial stages of focal adhesion formation after a
functionalised bead is bound to the surface ofa cell.
It is revealed that while the strain rate decreases over time (which could
have been observed using prior techniques), the stress rate actually in
creases. Such an experiment would not be possible with other techniques
as they are unable to simultaneously measure the elastic modulus and ac
tive stress generation of cells. Furthermore, application of external forces
would perturb the mechanical properties of the binding site and possibly
alter the cell’s physiological response to the bead.
46


2.4. CONTEXT OF THIS WORK
Ultrasound has found clinical applications for decades, however the resolu
tion is limited by the frequencies (and hence acoustic wavelengths) that
piezo transducers can probe. Brillouin light scattering offers a way to
probe gigahertz acoustic waves and biological applications are developing
fast, with different techniques suited to different applications. Phonon
microscopy offers better axial resolution than other Brillouin scattering
techniques due to the short axial length of the coherent acoustic pulse.
Previous studies using phonon microscopy have, however, demonstrated
limited biocompatibility due to use of ultraviolet pump lasers[2].
Many biomechanical techniques, such as microrheology, may take many
seconds to make each measurement; this limits the temporal resolution
and hence the rate at which changes to a system can be resolved. While
cytoskeletal structure has been studied in cells using fluorescence and me
chanical techniques, the changing mechanical properties of single cells has
not been resolved during treatment with cytoskeletal targetting drugs. In
Chapter 5 I demonstrate phonon microscopy measurements of actin dis
ruption in live cells, reporting the first time-course measurement of single
cells’ mechanical properties during this process by any technique. Using
the superior axial resolution of phonon microscopy compared to other Bril
louin and acoustic techniques, the longitudinal modulus of the basal actin
cortex is studied and found to not change significantly compared to that
of the cytoplasm.

Microrheology Methods
Development
In this chapter, I will detail the practical aspects of my work on microrheol
ogy. Much of what is introduced in this chapter will be applied in Chapter
4, in which I demonstrate microrheology measurements of live cells. This
will include the experimental setup, both the hardware I used and the soft
ware I used and developed. It will also cover the post-processing which I
applied to my data, and present experimental results to demonstrate both
the capabilities of the system and points of consideration for a microrheol
ogist. Relevant errors are discussed including particle tracking errors and
numerical errors and how these affect quantities calculated in microrheol
ogy.
Data analyses presented have been implemented in MATLAB and are
openly available via a GitHub repository[142]. The rationale guiding this
software design can be summarised by two main goals: suitability for ex
ploratory data analysis, and for creation of pipelines for reproducible pro
cessing of multiple data sets. The former is to allow examination of data
48


3.1. BACKGROUND
with minimal preconceptions or expectations for what one will find, while
the latter means that once one knows what is probed by given data set,
the analysis can be reapplied to many similar datasets such as different
experimental samples.
To achieve these two goals, two characteristics were implemented as far as
possible: modularity and generalisability of analysis – many different func
tions which act on the same data structures to homogenise the data analysis
experience while reusing code as much as possible; and optimised analysis
code – reduce execution times allowing rapid prototyping and exploratory
data analysis.
3.1 Background
3.1.1 Measuring Trap Stiffness
When a particle is close to the trap centre, the optical trap acts as a simple,
or Hookean, spring. Equivalently it could be called a linear elastic element
due to the force applied to the trapped particle,
⃗Ftrap = −riκieˆi ∀ i ∈ {x, y, z}, (3.1)
being linear with respect to ri, the displacement from trap centre in the
i direction, and κi, the trap stiffness in a given direction, where eˆi is the
unit vector in the i direction. Subscripts indicate the total trapping force
is a vector summed over all three spatial dimensions. This linear relation
makes optical traps ideal force transducers on the nanoscale.
Application of calibrated forces first requires calibration of trap stiffness.
49


3.1. BACKGROUND
There are several different methods for calibrating trap stiffness, however
only one is sample-independent: by appealing to the principle of equipar
tition of energy, it can be shown that a particle diffusing within the trap
will have position variance[115]
1 2
〈r2
i
〉 κi = 1
2 kBT, (3.2)
where 1
2 kBT , Boltzmann’s constant times absolute temperature, is the
thermal energy per degree of freedom and κ is the trap stiffness defined
above. This method is commonly used and requires only the ability to trap
and track a particle. The sample-independent nature has lead to it being
adopted as a calibration step for some active microrheology experiments[143,
144]. The equipartition method is subject to systematic errors as explained
in Section 3.3.1, which limits the maximum trap stiffness to which it can
be applied.
One alternative method is the drag force method, in which either the sample
is moved relative to a stationary trap, or the trap is moved relative to a
stationary sample. The displacement from the trap centre r(⃗ ) is measured,
and for low velocities where the linear approximation is valid, the trapping
force is calculated by[145]
⃗Ftrap = ⃗Fdrag → −κr⃗⃗ = −ν⃗β = −6πaην⃗, (3.3)
whereν⃗ is the velocity of the particle relative to the fluid, and β = 6πaη
is the drag coefficient for a particle of radius a in a medium with dynamic
viscosity η.
The drag force method has the principle flaw of the prerequisite knowledge
of the medium viscosity and bead size. Secondly, when moving the medium,
50


3.1. BACKGROUND
inertial effects may mean that the local fluid velocity differs from the stage
velocity[146]. Finally, if the medium is a complex fluid, the drag time
must be longer than the longest relaxation time of the fluid otherwise the
response will not be purely viscous. For these reasons, I do not use the
drag force method to calibrate trap stiffness in the work presented herein.
One major advantage of the drag force method is that it can measure the
total trapping force, i.e. the force required to escape the trap. A simple
experiment to find this is to slowly increase the stage speed until the bead
leaves the trap, and to note the speed at which this happens. The total
trapping force is not the same as the trap stiffness because the trapping
force is only linear with displacement for small displacements.
Another method for calibrating trap stiffness is to measure the characteris
tic relaxation time of the trap, or its reciprocal, the corner frequency. This
method also requires the medium viscosity to be known. If the viscosity
is unknown, the relaxation time and trap stiffness can be used to quantify
the viscosity, as will be explained in Section 3.2.4.
3.1.2 Optical Trap as Ideal Viscoelastic Material
The system of an optical trap and a viscous fluid can be considered an ideal
viscoelastic material. Consider that MSD, and thus also compliance, J(t),
monotonically increase for diffuse motion. Hence the longest relaxation
time that can be probed using a static optical trap is determined by the
time scale at which the trap elasticity dominates the probe motion. This is
exemplified in Figure 3.1 where varying the trap stiffness affects only the
plateau and the relaxation time, not the short-time diffuse behaviour.
If the suspension fluid can be approximated as Newtonian over the fre

3.1. BACKGROUND
Figure 3.1: Example mean squared displacement for an optically trapped bead measured with three different trap stiffnesses. The short lag time behaviour of each is identical because it is determined solely by free diffusion of the bead. The plateau height decreases with increasing trap stiffness. Characteristic relaxation times are marked with circles.
quency range probed, the compliance can be modelled as a Kelvin-Voigt
material (i.e.: the model viscoelastic material in Figure 2.3c). The charac
teristic relaxation time, tc, is therefore the time at which the compliance
of the trap equals the compliance of the fluid:
tc = 6πaη
κ , (3.4)
with η, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, bead radius a, and trap stiff
ness κ. This relaxation time is also known as the corner time, hence
the subscript. For 2.5 ➭m-radius sphere in water, held with trap stiffness
κ =0.1 pN/➭m, the trap relaxation sets the low-frequency limit of the band
width to 2 Hz.

this is needed, the effective viscosity is 5% higher than the actual viscosity
when the radius is one twelfth of the height. By performing all viscosity
measurements with the trapped particle at least 12 radii (i.e. 60 ➭m) from
the nearest surface, the Fax ́en’s law correction is negligible.
3.2 Methods
3.2.1 Optical Setup
Optical trapping and microrheology measurements were performed on the
same instrument, based around a Nikon Eclipse ti inverted microscope
body with a brightfield illumination module fitted. The optics are shown in
Figure 3.2. For optical trapping, a 3 W 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser is expanded
to fill the working face of a spatial light modulator. The reflected light is
then imaged via a periscope onto the back focal plane of the microscope.
Overfilling the back focal plane of the microscope approximates uniform
illumination at all spatial frequencies, creating the brightest focal spot and
hence greatest trap stiffness for a given power. The high numerical aperture
(NA) needed for optical trapping is provided by a Nikon Plan Fluor 100 x
(1.30 NA) oil immersion objective lens.
Illumination for brightfield imaging was via a Nikon dia illumination unit
containing both a halogen lamp and condenser optics housed above the
sample plane, making it trivial to perform imaging with transmitted light.
The condenser was set up in K ̈ohler illumination to maximise contrast
and hence minimize localisation, or static, error in microrheology exper
iments. Fluorescent imaging during microrheology and optical trapping

experiments used a CoolLED LED illumination unit and dichroic mirrors
mounted within the microscope filter wheel.
For microrheology experiments, I adjusted beam collimation by removing
lens L1 from the system. To do this, first the system was fully aligned using
a pair of apertures to align each optical element, and then L1 was removed
and the alignment of two steering mirrors (M4 and the second mirror in the
periscope) was fine-tuned to produce a symmetric focal spot in the sample
plane.
The divergent beam was coupled into the objective less efficiently, but
the maximum power available at the sample was still more than enough
for optical trapping. The advantage it brought was that the equilibrium
position for a trapped bead was a couple of microns above the imaging
plane, i.e.: the focal plane of the lens was not coincident with the centre
of the bead. I attempted to move L1 axially to produce the same effect,

but was not able to achieve the same image contrast while L1 was in the
system.
The defocus, coupled with lensing effects from the bead, meant that the
image of an optically trapped bead had a bright centre with a Gaussian
profile as shown by the inset to Figure 3.3. This meant trapped beads
could be tracked with ease using thresholding and a centroid algorithm
(Equation 3.6). Otherwise the low contrast would increase static error as
will be demonstrated in Section 3.3.1.
Microrheology experiments presented here used an OptiMOS sCMOS cam
era (QImaging, Canada). This sCMOS sensor has two features particularly
well suited for microrheology. Firstly the pixel values are read out at 16-bit
resolution, meaning they fall between 0 and 65,535 analogue-digital units
(ADU). Secondly the acquisition frame rate can be increased by select
ing a small region of interest (ROI) as shown in Figure 3.4, in which case
only part of the full field of view image is collected. Higher frame rates
increase the maximum frequency probed in microrheology as expected by
Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory.
The optical system also includes a spatial light modulator (SLM) and half
55

wave plate. These are present for experiments using holographic optical
trapping, which was not performed in this thesis. I will explain it nonethe
less for curiosity value: A hologram, analogous to a diffraction grating, is
calculated and displayed on the SLM, which selectively retards the phase
of the reflected light. The SLM pattern is imaged onto the back focal plane
using lenses 3 and 4, and hence the Fourier transform of the SLM pattern
is projected onto the sample plane. The half-wave plate allows rotation of
the beam polarisation, supporting experiments which require a particular
polarisation such as exciting nanoplasmonic structures.
3.2.2 Data Acquisition
To perform the particle tracking microrheology experiments reported here, I
have developed an acquisition and processing script in Micro-Manager[147]
using the built-in scripting interface and written in Beanshell, a language
based on Java. The script, explained in Appendix A, handles control of
the hardware, collecting images via a sequence acquisition on the camera.
Position time data is saved to disk along with a small portion of the ROI
images and two full field-of-view images (before and after the acquisition).
56


3.2. METHODS
During the sequence acquisition, the camera runs on its own internal clock,
so the time between each image is consistent and can be calculated using
the time between the first and Nth images. This section describes the
rationale behind this data acquisition methodology.
The first practical challenge of microrheology is the large amounts and
rates of data that need handling: the OptiMOS sCMOS camera I used for
microrheology experiments runs at up to 1500 frames per second with ROI
dimensions of 200 pixels × 100 pixels and 16-bit depth. These parameters,
typical for a single particle tracking experiment, generate 60 MB/s of image
data; this is comparable to the maximum data write speed one can expect
from a hard disk drive, assuming raw data is written to disk.
A short experiment may run for 5 minutes and result in 18 GB of im
age data, which is enough that (unless you write to disk while collecting
the data) memory management is a challenge even for modern computers.
Thus, a day of experiments may easily require hundreds of GBs of stor
age. Processing this data after the fact will require reading it back from
the hard drive, substantially increasing the time required to perform said
processing.
To overcome this, image data can be processed on-the-fly and only the
result needs saving. In this case, the challenge is to process the image
quickly enough not to create a backlog. In the scenario described above,
each image must be processed in only 0.6 ms, thus limiting the complexity
of any processing algorithms. The resultant data rate, around 6 kB/s, can
easily be written to PC storage while the acquisition is running allowing
arbitrarily long measurements to be performed.
Due to the nature of Beanshell as an interpreted language, steps such as
indexing into arrays are slow; this led to me adapting the ImageJ source
57


3.2. METHODS
code[148] for centroid calculations in Java:
Cx =
∑Nx x=1
∑Ny
y=1(Ixy − T )x
∑Nx x=1
∑Ny
y=1(Ixy − T ) , (3.6)
with the X centroid Cx given by a sum of the pixel intensities, Ixy, after
subtracting threshold value, T , weighted by their co-ordinates (x, y) across
the width and height of the image Nx and Ny, respectively. Pixel values
Ixy < T are considered background and are not included in the centroid
calculation. A second significant speed-up to the experimental workflow
was to develop Java code for saving the output position-time data in binary
formats. In both cases, the Java code is pre-compiled by installing it as an
ImageJ plug-in, thus substantially reducing the processing time required.
3.2.3 Post-Processing
Data saved from experiments mostly consists of position-time data which
is processed after the acquisition has concluded; the different processing
steps and outcomes have been summarised in Figure 3.5 to help the reader
understand how the different processing steps are related. Methods I have
implemented include co-ordinate transforms, digital filters to de-noise, and
calculation of the increment distributions. To elucidate mechanical com
pliance, the Mean-Squared Displacement (MSD) is calculated, and post
processing I have implemented for the MSD includes finding corner times,
measuring pseudo-diffusion parameters, sample viscosity and trap stiffness,
and numerical Fourier transforms to estimate viscoelastic moduli. With the
exception of the MATLAB msdanalyzer class[149], all processing has been
implemented in MATLAB by me, and all code (including my modifications
to the msdanalyzer code) are available on GitHub[142] under the GNU
GPL v3 license.

59


3.2. METHODS
3.2.3.1 Noise Filtering
Experimental noise is inevitable. Overhead lights introduce optical noise
at frequencies determined by the harmonics of the mains electricity, and to
avoid this experiments were performed in the dark. In a lab environment
with many electrical devices, there is electronic noise which is less easy to
isolate. For this reason, it is useful to be able to identify and remove noise
from position-time data.
Several recurrent sources of noise were identified in position-time data,
and a digital bandstop filter was used to remove this noise when han
dling position-time data in MATLAB. The filter was applied directly to
the position-time data with up to three narrow-band (<1 Hz) stop filters.
Figure 3.6 shows the Fourier spectrum of a position-time trace obtained
using the FFT algorithm. Clearly visible are noise peaks at 92, 124 and
151 Hz. The peaks at 93 and 124 Hz are inherent to all experiments on the
optical trapping rig, suggesting they arise from an electrical device in the
lab. The noise peak at 151 Hz is only present when the laser power supply
is turned on.
After applying the bandstop filter, the Fourier spectrum can be seen to
be broadly the same except for “gaps” at the stop band. The effect on
the MSD is readily apparent in Figure 3.6b: the raw MSD is higher at
all delay times and exhibits a characteristic “ripple” which is not present
in the filtered MSD. The inset shows that the raw MSD is roughly 1.2×
greater than the filtered MSD.

Insets show the spectra close to the peaks. b) MSD curves comparing raw and filtered. Note that in addition to the increase in MSD at all times, there is also a “ripple” effect at short times caused by the noise. Inset shows the ratio of raw to filtered MSD where the “ripple” is more prominent.
3.2.3.2 Co-ordinate Transforms
After de-noising, position-time data may be subjected to a co-ordinate
transform. Two transforms were implemented for different purposes. For
optical trapping data, a weaker trap allows broader bandwidth passive
microrheology measurements. As laser alignment is never perfect, the
trap strength is anisotropic leading to an elliptical position distribution.
Position-time data may therefore be transformed to place the major axis of
the position distribution (hence weak trap direction) along the X direction,
giving the broadest measurement bandwidth possible.
To measure trap anisotropy, a histogram-based method was developed and
tested using manually transformed experimental data. The transform used
was to scale the Y data by a factor of 0.75 before rotating the data by
45◦ to simulate a highly anisotropic trap. The histogram-based method
is as follows: first, the 2D position-time data is binned. Next, an ellipse
is fitted to the 2D probability distribution using the MATLAB function
61


3.2. METHODS

regionprops. Both steps are shown in Figure 3.7a where image colours
map to bin counts and fitted ellipse is shown with transformed axes. Note
that the shape of the distribution is more important than the centre - the
centre of the ellipse need not be at the point where the probability density is
highest. The orientation of the ellipse major axis relative to the X direction
is extracted and finally, the data is transformed using
X
′ = X cos(θ) − Y sin(θ) (3.7)
Y
′ = X sin(θ) + Y cos(θ) (3.8)
where θ is the orientation of the major axis relative to the X direction.
The transformed data is then used for further analyses such as calculating
the MSD as shown in Figure 3.7b. Comparing the two, it can be seen that
despite almost equal trap stiffnesses in X and Y, the trap stiffnesses are
quite different in X’ and Y’.
For data taken from beads affixed to cells, the direction normal to the cell
surface (henceforth referred to as radial) encodes the mechanical informa
tion of the cell. Thus it is desirable to view the motion in radial and tangen
tial directions, rather than X and Y. In the transformed co-ordinates, the
62


3.2. METHODS
cell is modelled as a tall cylinder, such that vertical displacements (which
are not measured but can sometimes be seen from before and after images)
are independent of radial displacements. A more complete 3D model of the
cell would require 3D imaging of each cell before microrheology measure
ments, and 3D particle tracking (e.g.: Matheson et. al.[150]). The model
assumptions are discussed in detail in Chapter 4.
The transformation used is
(x, y) → (r, r · θ) : (3.9)
r=
√
(ρx + Cx − Rx)2 + (ρy + Cy − Ry)2, (3.10)
θ = tan−1
( ρy + Cy − Ry ρx + Cx − Rx
)
. (3.11)
where the tangential co-ordinate is r · θ in order to have dimensions of
length. This is shown schematically in Figure 3.8. The centroid calculation
(Equation 3.6) uses co-ordinates within the ROI, denoted ρxy, which can
be related to the co-ordinates of the full field of view image using the ROI
position, Rxy, from the image metadata. Determining the cell position, Cxy,
is somewhat more complicated. For many of the cells, there is sufficient
contrast that a circle finding algorithm could be employed. Not all cells,
however, are perfectly round. Instead, I visually inspected the images of
the bead bound to the cell and drew a circle which approximates the edge
of the cell where the bead contacts the cell.
3.2.3.3 Increment Distributions
A characteristic of Brownian motion is the increment series,
∆r(t)τ = r(t + τ ) − r(t), (3.12)
63


3.2. METHODS
Figure 3.8: Geometry definitions used to convert from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical polar (Equation 3.11). The ROI is shown in yellow, the co-ordinates saved during acquisition are shown in cyan, and the cell is circled in orange.
for a position-time series r(t) and delay time τ . The increments are drawn
from a normal distribution with mean 0, and autocorrelation given by a
Dirac delta function ⟨∆r(t)∆r(t′)⟩ = δ(t − t′).
To determine whether a given position-time series, r(t), is driven by an
equilibrium process or not, I first consider the normalised increment series,
z(t)τ = ∆r(t)τ − ∆r(t)τ
ST D(∆r(t)τ ) , (3.13)
with ∆r(t)τ denoting the mean and ST D(∆r(t)τ ) the standard deviation.
An example normalised increment distribution from an optically trapped
bead is shown in Figure 3.9a, along with a normal distribution. The ex
perimental data shows good agreement with the normal distribution out to
|z| ≃ 4. There are observations of larger increments, appearing as broad
tails, but it is worth noting that the number of observations of each in
crement |z| > 4 is less than 10, compared to hundreds of thousands at
z = 0.
I now consider the effects of static and dynamic error on the increment dis
tributions. An example of each is also shown in Figure 3.9 (using the same
64


3.2. METHODS
data as Figures 3.14 and 3.15), where the respective datasets are labelled
“2350 ADU” and “100 ms”. Both static and dynamic errors cause the cen
tral peak of the distribution to be sharper and the tails to be broader than
the normal distribution. Notably, the static error causes a noisier incre
ment distribution, while dynamic error affects the shape of the distribution
without adding noise. Further discussion of these particle tracking errors
can be found in Section 3.3.1.
To characterise the closeness of z to a normal distribution, I have used
the non-Gaussian parameter introduced by Rahman[151] and since applied
to studies of colloidal systems[152] and cytoskeletal rearrangements[90].
Rahman defined a series of parameters, however I have only used the second
order parameter,
N GP (τ ) = ⟨zτ 4⟩
3⟨zτ 2⟩2 − 1, (3.14)
where ⟨z4
τ ⟩ = ∑z=∞
z=−∞ z4p(z) denotes the mean of the z4 distribution and
similarly for z2
τ.
Now I will examine the statistics of diffusion and whether there are enough
observations of a given delay time for the MSD to accurately represent the
motion. Figure 3.9b shows the NGP as a function of lag time for increasing
observation duration, T . Examining a given lag time (say τ = 10−3 s), it
can be seen that for T > 100τ , the NGP is close to 0 and hence the
observation duration is adequate to say that the motion is Brownian on
that time scale.
This has implications for determining observation duration in microrheol
ogy studies: if the experimenter wishes to measure the creep compliance,
J(t), at a given maximum time, they will need the experimental observa
tion to be 100 times that time. In other words, if you wish to measure the
stiffness of a gel at t = 1 s, an observation of 100 s is required to have good

Gaussian statistics. This is considered in terms of random errors in Section
3.3.2.
Figure 3.9 also shows the effects of static and dynamic error on the non
Gaussian parameter. As may be expected, the static error only affects the
NGP on timescales where the actual motion is less than the static error, i.e.:
the shortest times where the apparent MSD exhibits an up-tick. Dynamic
error, on the other hand, causes the increment distribution to depart from
normality at all time scales, with increasing NGP at longer times.
3.2.3.4 MSD Calculation
Here is a short explanation of the code I use to calculate Mean-Squared
Displacement (MSD, introduced in Section 2.2.2), which is defined as
M SD = 〈∆r2(τ )〉 = 〈(r(t) − r(t + τ ))2〉
t = 2nDτ. (3.15)
Post-processing large volumes of data can also be challenging, especially
if you want the processing to occur in reasonable timescales. Most of my
66


3.2. METHODS
analysis of particle tracking microrheology data is via the MSD statistic;
this was calculated using code adapted from Tarantino’s[149] msdanalyser
class in MATLAB. Tarantino’s original code is both elegant and robust to
position-time tracks of varying durations where observations may be irreg
ularly spaced or missing, but these features mean it is inefficient for exper
imental data consisting of long tracks of observations spaced uniformly in
time.
Several important modifications were made to suit my purposes: Instead
of calculating all possible delay times within each track, I check that each
track in a batch of processing has the same uniform time spacing and
then select logarithmically spaced delay times. This dramatically reduces
the processing required as the MSD is then only calculated at these delay
times; while I would like to give a measurement of the speed-up achieved,
the original code would take days to calculate the MSD for a track of 1
million observations while my modified version runs in a few seconds.
3.2.4 Quantifying Viscoelastic Properties
Following the Generalised Stokes-Einstein Relation (GSER), if the motion
of a particle is dominated by thermal driving forces, the MSD is equiv
alent to the creep compliance of the particle’s environment. The MSD
can be analysed in the time domain, or it can be used to calculate the
complex modulus of the material and further analysed in the frequency
domain. First it was calculated using code adapted from Tarantino’s[149]
msdanalyser class in MATLAB. Tarantino’s original code is both elegant
and robust to position-time tracks of varying durations where observations
may be irregularly spaced or missing, but these features mean it is ineffi
cient for experimental data consisting of long tracks of observations spaced
67


3.2. METHODS
uniformly in time.
Several important modifications were made to suit my purposes: Instead
of calculating all possible delay times within each track, I check that each
track in a batch of processing has the same uniform time spacing and
then select logarithmically spaced delay times. This dramatically reduces
the processing required as the MSD is then only calculated at these delay
times; while I would like to give a measurement of the speed-up achieved,
the original code would take days to calculate the MSD for a track of 1
million observations while my modified version runs in a few seconds.
For an optically trapped bead in a fluid such as water, the creep com
pliance can be approximated using Kelvin-Voigt ideal viscoelastic model
(henceforth referred to as K-V model) as discussed in Section 3.1.2. The
two parameters of the K-V model are the stiffness and the characteristic
relaxation time. The stiffness is the optical trap stiffness, measured using
either the position variance or the MSD plateau. The characteristic re
laxation time is measured using two methods I have developed, one time
domain method and one frequency domain method, both of which will be
described below.
3.2.4.1 Time Domain Analysis
Least-squares fitting was used qualitatively and quantitatively, with inter
pretation by inspection of MSD curves aided by estimation of the gradient
using a “rolling fit” method: applying a least-squares fit to a small number
of points in the curve (normally 5 or 10) to reduce the noise in the estimated
gradient. To speed this up, an algebraic least-squares estimator [111] was
used, resulting in a 300-fold speed-up compared to using MATLAB’s curve
fitting toolbox. The result can be seen in Figure 3.10i, where the rolling-fit
68


3.2. METHODS
method has been used to estimate local power-law exponents (equivalent
to gradient on a log-log plot).
Different regions on the MSD curve indicate the compliance of different
physical processes. In the ideal case, the MSD of an optically trapped
bead exhibits an extended plateau where the power-law exponent is 0.
Experimental data, on the other hand, typically has a noisy plateau and
may also exhibit an up-tick at long times due to drift in the system. The
noisy plateau can be seen in Figure 3.10Bi, while both the noise and the
up-tick can be seen in Figure 3.6b.
To calculate the trap stiffness, the variance could be used, but this is sen
sitive to any long-time up-tick caused by drift, in which case it will under
estimate the trap stiffness. Instead, the power-law exponent can be used
to identify a time range for the plateau, and the mean MSD over this time
range can be taken to be the plateau MSD.
The characteristic relaxation time for an optically trapped bead is the time
at which the short-time (viscous dominated) compliance is equal to the
long-time (elastic dominated) compliance. Measured and predicted relax
ation times are shown for both simulated data (column A) and experimen
tal data (column B) in Figure 3.10. The time domain method is explained
below, while the frequency domain method is explained in the next section.
The time domain method is demonstrated in Figure 3.10ii: Two time ranges
are chosen manually, and a linear fit is performed to data from each range
in the form log(τ ) against log(MSD). The intercept time of the fits is cal
culated algebraically and taken to be the characteristic relaxation time.
In the situation of a trapped bead in a Newtonian fluid, the time domain
method is exact. For experimental situations such as a bead trapped in

water, the fluid is sufficiently close to being a Newtonian fluid over the
experimentally accessible time range that it can be approximated as such.
The time domain method is based upon the observation that the short
time MSD is given by the time-invariant viscosity and the long-time MSD
is given by the trap stiffness:
M SD(τ ≪ τc) = kBT
3πa
τ
η , (3.16)
M SD(τ ≫ τc) = 2kBT
κ , (3.17)
where kBT is the thermal energy, a the bead radius, τc the corner time, η
the Newtonian viscosity, and κ the trap stiffness. As long as the experi
mental systems is well described by the K-V model, extrapolation beyond
the fitting range is valid and the intercept time of the two fits gives the
characteristic relaxation time.
70


3.2. METHODS
From the two equations above, the viscosity of the fluid can be inferred
by using the corner time and the trap stiffness as per Equation 3.4. This
follows from the viscous compliance at the corner time being equal to the
time-invariant compliance of the trap. Thus the viscosity of a sample can
be measured with minimal assumptions and sensitivity to noise. I refer to
this method as the Kelvin-Voigt (K-V) method as it is derived from the
optical trap acting as a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic solid.
Alternatively, viscosity could be calculated using the Stokes-Einstein rela
tion, Equation 2.14. The experimental MSD curve can be analysed to find
the diffusion coefficient, D, and hence the solvent viscosity, η. I refer to
this method as the Stokes-Einstein Relation (SER) method.
To measure the diffusion coefficient, I have investigated two possibilities.
The first is least-squares fitting to a power-law equation,
log(M SD) = log(2D) + αlog(τ ), (3.18)
with power-law exponent α. Fitting has the advantage that the power-law
exponent can reveal rheological properties of the system such as the loss
tangent, indicating whether the behaviour of the system is viscous, elastic,
or viscoelastic at a given timescale.
Alternatively, the diffusion coefficient can be defined as a function of lag
time,
D(τ ) = M SD(τ )/τ, (3.19)
which has two advantages: firstly, it is less sensitive to errors affecting
the power-law exponent; secondly it is insensitive to the lag time being
analysed. The second point is important as power-law fitting finds D using
the y-intercept of the best-fit line. Clearly if the time range being analysed
71


3.2. METHODS
is far from 1s, a small change in α will lead to a large change in D.
It is also possible to calculate the viscosity using the Fourier Transform
(FT) of the MSD. Recall that the loss modulus G′′(ω) = ηω, and thus the
imaginary part of the complex modulus can be used to calculate η. Several
methods for optimising the SNR on the FT are discussed in Section 3.3.3,
and the viscosity calculated by two of these has been included here.
For comparison, I present the results of each method when applied to the
same data of an optically trapped bead. Figure 3.11 shows a set of MSD
curves taken with different trap stiffnesses controlled by varying the laser
power, and the viscosities calculated by each method. As can be seen, the
K-V method provides substantially better agreement with theory than the
SER method. The non-fitting SER method is less noisy, but both SER
methods systematically overestimate the viscosity relative to the expected
value and the K-V method. Each of the Fourier transform methods over
estimates η by approximated a factor of π; the possibility of a numerical
error in the Fourier transform has been ruled out as my implementation
and one from Smith et. al.[153] have been compared and give exactly the
same results.
The K-V method also has another conceptual advantage: By plotting
κ/6πa against ηwater/τc, the viscosity of a multiple measurements in a sam
ple can be quickly compared, both to each other and to the viscosity of
water. This is shown as the inset to Figure 3.11b. The data agrees well
with the predicted viscosity of water over a wide range of trap strengths,
while an increase in viscosity would place data points below the dashed
line.

3.2.4.2 Frequency Domain Analysis
Performing a Fourier transform on rheological data is non-trivial due to
non-convergence of the Fourier transform integral and truncation errors in
troduced by numerical transforms. To this end, I implemented the method
proposed by Evans et. al.[109] and the improvements proposed by Tassieri
et. al. [117, 153], as discussed in Section 2.2.3. Key to this method is ac
curate numerical inversion over a wide range of frequencies. Characterising
and minimising the numerical error in the inversion process is discussed
later in Section 3.3.3.
Equivalent to the characteristic relaxation time, the characteristic relax
ation frequency, or corner frequency, of an optical trap can be used to find
the viscosity of the suspension fluid. This is the frequency at which the
elastic and viscous moduli are equal, shown with a dashed line in Figure
3.12 A and B i). To simplify the numerical approach, I considered the loss

)

The fitting and result in the frequency domain are shown in Figure 3.12 for
simulated and real MSD. The fit results are compared to prediction and
the time domain method in Figure 3.10i, where they are found to be in
excellent agreement.

3.3. DISCUSSION
3.3 Discussion
Clearly no experimental system is ideal however simple models can still
aid in understanding them. For example, the model of the optical trap as
a Newtonian fluid in parallel with a Hookean spring allows for easy and
accurate quantification of fluid viscosity, and this approach maintains its
validity when applied to more complex systems. The experimental system
exhibits small departures from ideal behaviour however these are negligible
compared to either the random errors associated with observing stochastic
processes for finite time durations, or the numerical errors introduced in
data processing as shown in Figure 3.17.
3.3.1 Systematic Errors
There are three main sources of systematic error in particle tracking experi
ments: external noise and the two particle tracking-specific errors identified
by Savin and Doyle[154, 155] as static and dynamic error. External noise
comes from various lab sources, which have been eliminated where possible
such as by turning off the overhead fluorescent lights in the lab. Interference
from other electronic devices, such as the power supply for the trapping
laser, cannot be avoided but has been characterised as shown in Figure
3.6. These noise sources systematically increase the MSD at all lag times
but can be removed with a narrowband stop filter as described in Section
3.2.3.1.
75


3.3. DISCUSSION
3.3.1.1 Static Error
Static error is caused by the contrast to noise ratio of the images, placing
a limit on the smallest displacement it is possible to track. This has the
consequence of limiting the minimum compliance that can be accurately
measured by passive microrheology. It can be modelled by relating true
position, x, to apparent position xˆ = x + N (ε2), using N (ε2) to denote a
random variable drawn from a normal distribution with variance ε2. Ac
counting for static error, the apparent MSD can be written as
⟨∆rˆ2(τ )⟩ = ⟨∆r2(τ )⟩ + ε2, (3.24)
where ε2 is the magnitude of the static error. While static error introduces
a random error on the apparent position, it causes a systematic increase in
the apparent MSD. Hence if the true MSD is not much greater than the
static error there will be significant overestimation of the MSD.
I characterised this error in the optical trapping system when imaging 5 ➭m
diameter polystyrene beads in transmission by drying polystyrene beads
onto a 170 ➭m thick coverslip and then attaching the coverslip to a 2 mm
microscope slide for imaging such that the beads were sandwiched between
the coverslip and microscope slide.
To separate the displacement due to vibrations in the system from the ap
parent displacement due to static error, I imaged two beads simultaneously
and calculate the difference between the bead co-ordinates. While the mea
sured position of each bead individually is affected by both vibrations and
static noise, the vibrations are the same for both beads and the apparent
difference is given by δxˆ = δx + √2N (ε2). Thus the difference between the
measured bead positions allows a direct estimation of the magnitude of the

static error.
Figure 3.13 shows how static error varies with focal position. This vari
ation comes from the differing contrast at different focal positions. With
this imaging setup, it is possible to obtain static error as low as 1 nm2.
During microrheology measurements using with optical tweezers, however,
the bead will be free to move in z, and thus static error will be higher. For
this reason, when considering experimental data, MSDs below 100 nm2 are
treated cautiously.
The effect of static error on the MSD of an optically trapped bead can
be seen in Figure 3.14, where I artificially reduced the spatial resolution
by increasing the threshold value in the image processing. At the shortest
delay times, high threshold values cause the apparent MSD to depart from
the true value. At lag times such that the bead displacements are much
greater than the static error, the experimental MSD is almost unaffected.
77


3.3. DISCUSSION
Figure 3.14: MSD curves taken from a single trapped bead (shown in inset i) with different acquisition parameters demonstrating the effect of static error on MSD with varying contrast (artificially induced here by changing the threshold level, shown as dashed lines on inset ii). Background subtracted images are shown in inset iii, along with line plots through the background subtracted images. Scale bars are 4 ➭m.
This can be verified using the non-Gaussian parameter as shown in Figure
3.9: static error only affects the increment distribution at short lag times,
allowing a cutoff lag time to be determined above which the MSD has
insignificant influence of static error.
In optical trapping experiments, static error is minimised by changing the
axial position of the trap equilibrium via removal of lens L1 (Figure 3.3)
along with use of a bright halogen lamp configured in K ̈ohler illumination.
For cell and bead experiments, the z-position of the bead is determined by
the cell, allowing a focal position to be chosen to minimise static error.
78


3.3. DISCUSSION
3.3.1.2 Dynamic Error
Dynamic error is caused by bead motion during the exposure time, and
limits the shortest timescale over which it is possible to accurately track
the bead position; in general this is difficult to quantify and depends on
both the exposure time and the rheology of the sample (see [155] for more
detail). The exact time-scale over which dynamic error has significant
effect depends on the power-law exponent of the MSD at time equal to
the exposure time, with a lower exponent (to a minimum of 0) causing
dynamic error to have an effect at longer time-scales relative to the exposure
time[155]. In all cases, dynamic error causes underestimation of the MSD.
For a micron-sized bead optically trapped in water, the timescales affected
by dynamic error will depend on the stiffness of the trap. If the trap
relaxation time is much longer than the exposure time, dynamic error will
have an effect at lag times up to a few times the exposure time, hence
causing an overestimation of the viscosity; if the trap relaxation time is
similar or shorter than the exposure time, the dynamic error will cause
underestimation of the MSD at all lag times, causing an overestimation of
trap stiffness. These effects are seen clearly in Figure 3.15, where it presents
on MSD curves as super-diffuse motion in the shortest delay times. That
is to say, power-law exponent α > 1 as demonstrated by the dashed lines.
Here, dynamic error is causing an underestimation of the mean-squared
displacement of the particle being tracked.
As the exposure time approaches the trap relaxation time, the effect of
dynamic error increases at the shortest lag times. In the case of the 10 ms
exposure time, there is no time scale where the diffuse motion of the bead
is accurately measured. When the exposure time exceeds the trap relax
ation time, the apparent plateau height (elastic compliance) is significantly

reduced and no diffuse motion is seen. This can be seen with the 100 ms
exposure time. To understand the effect, consider the diffusion of the bead
within the trap. During the 100 ms exposure time, the bead has diffused
across the entire length scale of the trap, and the image acquired is an av
erage of all positions the bead occupies. Thus the MSD between sequential
frames (100 ms apart) will be much lower than expected.
While estimating dynamic error is non-trivial, minimising it is not. As
dynamic error is the effect of motion blur on particle tracking, it can be
simply seen that minimising the exposure time will minimise dynamic error.
I have used exposures times of 100 to 250 ➭s even when increasing exposure
time would not slow down acquisition, whilst ensuring there is plenty of
light to keep static error low. In other words, if the ROI is such that the
camera would run at 1,000 fps, an exposure time of up to 1 ms would not
slow the acquisition. In this case, I would still use an exposure of 100 ➭s
because this minimises dynamic error.
80


3.3. DISCUSSION
I also disregard the first few points of the MSD from quantitative analysis,
based on the MSD power-law exponent. This is justified by Figure 3.15,
where the power-law exponents have an increase at the shortest times which
is caused by dynamic error. While the effect of dynamic error while probing
water (with sensible image acquisition parameters) is small, the effect of
dynamic error when probing cells or other viscoelastic materials can be
much larger. Thus I chose to err on the side of caution and if there is
an increase in power-law exponent at the beginning of an MSD curve, I
exclude those time points.
The reader may notice that the bead image from the 100 ms exposure time
is saturated (Figure 3.15 inset bottom row). By a simple geometric ar
gument it can be seen that image saturation has no effect on the centroid
calculation: The centroid for a discretely sampled distribution (e.g. a Gaus
sian image of a bead) is the same as the first moment of that distribution,
and equal to the integral of the distribution multiplied by the position
co-ordinate, normalised to the area under the peak. Or, in 1 dimension,
Cx ≡
∫∞
0 xp(x)dx
∫∞
0 p(x)dx , (3.25)
where Cx is the centroid (or first moment) and p(x) is the distribution in
question. Note that the first moment, centroid, and centre of area are all
equivalent.
Consider now a Gaussian distribution and a truncated Gaussian distribu
tion, where values above some truncation value are instead set equal to that
truncation value. These are good approximations of the bead image and
saturated bead image. The symmetry of the distribution suffices to show
that image saturation has no bearing on dynamic error. It will, however,
have an effect on static error: the precision of the first moment calculation
81


3.3. DISCUSSION
is proportional to the area between the threshold and the truncation value
so increasing illumination brightness beyond saturation will increase static
error.
3.3.2 Random Errors
A practical challenge of microrheology is one shared by all studies of stochas
tic processes: How long do you need to watch a sequence of random events
for the time-average to accurately represent the process behind the events?
In passive microrheology, one could consider the number of independent
observations of the MSD for a given delay time. If the experimenter wishes
to probe the MSD with at a delay time of up to 10 s, consider that 100 s
of experimental data will have only 10 independent samples at this delay
time.
To demonstrate the importance of adequate sampling, a single position
time recording, consisting of 500,000 samples collected at 1.214 kHz, was
truncated to varying durations. Figure 3.16 shows MSD curves, trap stiff
ness, κ, and diffusion coefficient, D, calculated using between 10 and
500,000 samples. When viewing the MSD curves, especially notice the
change at the highest τ of each one, where statistics are poorest. Diffusion
coefficients were calculated by fitting the short lag-time MSD to
M SD = 2Dτ α, (3.26)
where D is the diffusion coefficient and α is the power-law exponent.
To assess random error with varying sample number, trap stiffness and
diffusion coefficient were compared to the values found using all 500,000
samples. Brownian dynamics simulations were performed following the

method of Volpe[156], using the same parameters as the experiment. For
each number of samples plotted in Figure 3.16, 1,000 trajectories of that
length were generated and the trap stiffness and diffusion coefficient were
quantified. The standard deviation of these 1,000 simulated measurements
was used to estimate the random error for the experiment, shown as error
bars on panels b) and c).
To achieve an accurate measure of trap stiffness, using 160 s or 200,000
samples will give a relative error of 7%, however this will depend on the
trap stiffness as a less stiff trap will have a longer relaxation time and 160 s
will contain fewer independent observations at lag time equal to the trap
relaxation time. Diffusion coefficient, on the other hand, requires fewer
samples and reaches 9% relative error for 24 s or 30,000 samples. This is
because the analysis used here (Equation 3.18, log(M SD) = log(2D) +
αlog(τ )) utilises MSD data from the shortest lag times to calculate the
viscosity, and the shortest lag times have the best statistics as there are
more independent observations.
83


3.3. DISCUSSION
3.3.2.1 Image Analysis
Position-time data has thus far been acquired using video microscopy and
centre-of-mass tracking, with real-time image acquisition and processing
enabling longer observation durations. The centre-of-mass particle tracking
relies upon the bead image having a bright centre, and no other features
brighter than the threshold in the region of interest (ROI) used for image
acquisition. It is easy to ensure this in the case of optically trapped beads
in transparent solutions, or beads attached to cells, because there are few
features visible and a small ROI is used. In samples where this is not the
case, a more advanced image analysis may improve ease of use and reduce
errors on particle tracking.
One possibility is to use the cross-correlations of subsequent image frames in
order to calculate the displacement between subsequent frames, or between
the first and Nth frames. In either, an image kernel containing the bead
is convolved with a subsequent image to find the position of the bead
within the image, and hence the displacement between the two images.
Considering the image and the kernel as matrices Mij and kij of pixel
intensities, the cross-correlation can be written
Cxy =
x+w
∑
i=x
y+h
∑
j=y
Mijkij, (3.27)
where w and h are the width and height of the image kernel, respectively.
The greatest value in the cross-correlation matrix corresponds to the kernel
position closest to the bead position in that image, i.e. the bead position
to the nearest pixel. The bead position can be found with greater precision
by calculating the centroid of the cross-correlation.
The cross-correlation analysis could be implemented using MATLAB’s xcorr
84


3.3. DISCUSSION
function, however this would require every image acquired to be saved and
processed after the experiment. To avoid the additional challenges brought
by storing such volumes of data, this could be implemented in Java and
run by Micro-Manager during data acquisition. The implementation would
need to be tested for performance, both in terms of computation time and
static error. Using image cross-correlations would reduce static error when
tracking particles against noisy backgrounds, allowing accurate microrhe
ology study of samples such as tissues. It would also allow particles to be
tracked over a wider axial range as the analysis would no longer rely on a
central bright spot.
3.3.3 Optimising SNR for Complex Moduli
Firstly, the MSD data must be as clean as possible - experimental noise
should be removed as described in Section 3.2.3.1. Optimal SNR could be
achieved by fitting MSD data to an analytical equation such as the K-V
model (N M SD = 1 − e−λτ ), from which an analytical expression exists for
the Fourier Transform. Use of fitting models, however, is limited to data
for which a preconceived fit exists; perhaps more importantly, it does not
distinguish between the noise which one wishes to remove and the system’s
departure from model behaviour.
For example, one may fit the K-V model to data from a bead suspended
inside a gel, expecting a viscous short-time response and an elastic long
time response. If the gel actually exhibits sub-diffusion on short times, or
a time-dependent elasticity on long times, the model will not reflect this
and the resulting Fourier transform and complex modulus will be incor
rect. Hence I have avoided fitting models to my experimental data, instead
focussing on how to optimise the processing for best SNR.
85


3.3. DISCUSSION
In Figure 3.17 I demonstrate different methods to improve the SNR of the
resulting viscoelastic modulus for an optically trapped bead in water. Since
water can be approximated as a Newtonian fluid over the relevant time
scales, the viscoelastic modulus should be well described by the Kelvin
Voigt model, with a constant storage modulus given by the trap strength
and a loss modulus depending on frequency, G′′(ω) = 0.97ω mPa. The 6
methods have been denoted by Roman numerals, and the raw MSD data
is shown as an inset. At long lag times, the MSD exhibits an up-tick
due to pointing instability of the laser. For all methods, as described in
Section 2.2.3, the MSD is interpolated before using the Fourier transform
as described by Evans et. al.[109]. This interpolation pushes the high
frequency truncation errors beyond the bandwidth of the experiment.
Method i) is to simply use the entire MSD curve. This gives good SNR for
frequencies where the viscous behaviour dominates, but poor SNR for the
elastic plateau due to the slight gradient, as can be seen by the non-smooth
behaviour on the loss modulus at frequencies below 100 Hz. At the lowest
frequencies, the up-tick in MSD causes both storage and loss moduli to
depart from expected behaviour.
Method ii) is to truncate the data at the gradient minima. This causes a
large improvement to the SNR at low frequencies, however it also reduces
the lowest frequency represented in the moduli. Method iii) is to truncate
at the gradient minima, and replace the truncated data with a linear fit of
the same gradient. Because the long-time behaviour of the experimental
MSD is non-smooth, replacing with a smooth fit improves the SNR, but
because the fit has a non-zero gradient, the loss modulus departs from
expected behaviour at low frequencies.
Method iv) is to truncate the data, and replace with a smooth line of
