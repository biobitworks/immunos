Preface
The first edition of Principles of Tissue Engineering was published almost a quarter-of-a-century ago—back in the 1990s when the term “tissue engineering” was first coined—and quickly became the most widely relevant and cited textbook in the field. Since that time there have been powerful developments, including breakthroughs at all stages of development, ranging from two Nobel Prizes for pioneering work in the area of stem cells, which could be used as an unlimited source of cells for repair and engineering of tissues and organs, to actual clinical therapies, ranging from skin and bladder replacement to cartilage, bone, and cardiovascular repair. The fifth edition of “Principles” covers all of this tremendous progress as well as the latest advances in the biology and design of functional tissues and organs for repair and replacement, from mathematical models to clinical reality. We have also added Anthony Atala, the W.H. Boyce Professor and Director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, as a new editor and have expanded the book to include a new section on emerging technologies, including 3D bioprinting and biomanufacturing for tissue-engineering products. As in the previous editions, the book attempts to simultaneously connect the basic sciences with the potential application of tissue engineering to diseases affecting specific organ systems. While the fifth edition furnishes a much needed update of the rapid progress that has been achieved in the field in the last 6 years, we have retained the fundamentals of tissue engineering, as well as those facts and sections which, while not new, will assist scientists, clinicians, and students in understanding this exciting area of biology and medicine. The fifth edition of “Principles” is divided into an introductory section, followed by 23 parts starting with the basic science of the field and moving upward into applications and clinical experience. The organization
remains largely unchanged, combining the prerequisites for a general understanding of cellular differentiation and tissue growth and development, the tools and theoretical information needed to design tissues and organs, as well as a presentation by the world’s experts of what is currently known about each specific organ system, including breast, endocrine and metabolism, ophthalmic, oral/dental applications, skin, and the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, kidney and genitourinary, musculoskeletal, nervous, and respiratory systems. We have again striven to create a comprehensive book that, on one hand, strikes a balance among the diversity of subjects that are related to tissue engineering, including biology, chemistry, material science, medicine, and engineering, while emphasizing those research areas that are likely to be of clinical value in the future. While we cannot describe all of the new and updated material of the fifth edition, we continue to provide expanded coverage of stem cells, including neonatal, postnatal, embryonic, and induced pluripotent stem cells and progenitor populations that may soon lead to new tissueengineering therapies for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and a wide variety of other diseases that afflict humanity. This up-to-date coverage of stem cell biology and other emerging technologies is complemented by updated chapters on gene therapy, the regulatory process, and the challenges of tissue engineering for food and in vitro meat production, which someday may end up a routine part of our food system, potentially reducing environmental pollution and land use. As with previous editions, we believe the result is a comprehensive textbook that will be useful to students and experts alike.

Clinical need
Tissue and organ failure due to disease, injury, and developmental defects has become a major economical and healthcare concerns [1]. At present, use of donated tissues and organs is the clinical practice to address this situation. However, due to the shortage of organ donors, the increasing number of people on the transplant waiting lists, and an ever-increasing aging population, dependence on donated tissues and organs is not a practical approach. In addition, due to severe logistical constraints, many organs from donors cannot be matched, transported, and successfully transplanted into a patient within the very limited time available. In the United States alone, more than 113,000 people are on the National Transplant Waiting list and around 17,000 people have been waiting for more than 5 years for an organ transplant (US Department of Health and Human Services, Organ Procurement and Transplantation network; https://optn. transplant.hrsa.gov; data as of February, 2019). To address this critical medical need, tissue engineering (TE) has become a promising option. TE and regenerative medicine (RM) are multidisciplinary fields that combine knowledge and technologies from different fields such as biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, pharmaceutical, and material science to develop therapies and products for repair or replacement of damaged tissues and organs [2,3]. The process of TE is multistep and involves engineering of different components that will be combined to generate the desired neo-tissue or organ (Fig. 1.1). Today, this field has advanced so much that it is being used to develop therapies for patients that have severe chronic disease affecting major organs such as the kidney, heart, and liver. For example, in the United States alone, around 5.7 million people are suffering from
congestive heart failure [5], and around 17.9 million people die or cardiovascular diseases globally (World Health Organization data on Cardiovascular disease; https://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/en/). TE can help such patients by providing healthy engineered tissues (and possibly whole organ in future) to replace their diseased tissue for restoring function. For example, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide health crisis that can be treated, but it also depends on organ donation. In the United States alone, around 30 million people are suffering from CKD (Center for Disease Control & Prevention; National Chronic Kidney Disease Fact Sheet 2017; https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/pdf/ kidney factsheet), while close to 10% of the population is affected worldwide. Liver disease is another healthcare problem, which is responsible for approximately 2 million deaths per year worldwide [6]. Other diseases or conditions that can benefit from TE technologies include skin burns, bone defects, nervous system repair, craniofacial reconstruction, cornea replacement, volumetric muscle loss, cartilage repair, vascular disease, pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal tissue repair, genitourinary tissue repair, and cosmetic procedures. The field of TE, with its goal and promise of providing bioengineered, functional tissues, and organs for repair or replacement could transform clinical medicine in the coming years.
Current state of the field
TE has seen continuous evolution since the past two decades. It has also seen assimilating of knowledge and technical advancements from related fields such as material science, rapid prototyping, nanotechnology, cell biology, and developmental biology. Specific advancements that have benefited TE as a field in recent years include novel

biomaterials [7], three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technologies [8], integration of nanotechnology [9], stemcell technologies such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [9,10], and gene editing technology such as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) [11]. All these have led to promising developments in the field that include smart biomaterials, organoids, and 3D tissue for disease modeling and drug development, whole organ engineering, precise control and manipulation of cells and their environments, and personalized TE therapies. Biomaterials are critical components of many current TE strategies. Recent developments in this field that are benefiting TE include synthesis of new biomaterials that can respond to their local environment and cues (smart biomaterials). Advancements in 3D bioprinting technologies are at the core of many developments in TE. It is now possible to print multiple biocompatible materials (both natural and synthetic), cells, and growth factors together into complex 3D tissues, many with functional vascular networks, which match their counterparts in vivo. We have also learned a great deal about cell sourcing, culture, expansion, and control of differentiation. This is also true for stem cells, where new sources such as placenta, amniotic fluid, and iPSCs have been explored and optimized for use. Vascularization and
innervation in bioengineered tissue is a continuing challenge essential to warrant sustained efforts success of tissues implanted in vivo would be very low. Therefore there is a need for greater understanding of vascularization and innervation as applied to bioengineered tissues. This is an ongoing effort, and the results we are seeing from various studies are encouraging. Biofabrication technologies are playing a great role in this regards. Several engineered tissues are moving toward clinical translation or are already being used in patients. These include cartilage, bone, skin, bladder, vascular grafts, cardiac tissues, etc. [12]. Although, complex tissues such as liver, lung, kidney, and heart have been recreated in the lab and are being tested in animals, their clinical translation still has many challenges to overcome. For in vitro use, miniature versions of tissues called organoids are being created and used for research in disease modeling, drug screening, and drug development. They are also being applied in a diagnostic format called organ-on-achip or body-on-a-chip, which can also be used for the above stated applications. Indeed, the development of 3D tissue models that closely resemble in vivo tissue structure and physiology are revolutionizing our understanding of diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer and can also accelerate development of new and improved therapies for multiple diseases and disorders. This approach is also expected to drastically reduce the number of animals that are currently being used for testing and research. In addition, 3D tissue models and organ-on-a-chip or body-on-achip platforms can support advancement of personalized medicine by offering patient-specific information on the effects of drugs, therapies, environmental factors, etc. Development of advanced bioreactors represent another recent developments that are supporting clinical translation of TE technologies. Such bioreactors can better mimic in vivo environments by provide physical and biochemical control of regulatory signals to cells and tissue being cultured. Examples of such control include application of mechanical forces, control of electrical pacing, dynamic culture components, induction of cell differentiation. Incorporation of advanced sensors and imaging capabilities within these bioreactors are also allowing for real-time monitoring of culture parameters such as pH, oxygen consumption, cell proliferation, and factor secretion from a growing tissue. 3D modeling is also a new tool relevant to TE that provides great opportunities and better productivity for translational research, with wide clinical applicability [13]. Recent advancements in specific field that are helping advance TE are discussed next.
Smart biomaterials
Smart biomaterials are biomaterials that can be designed to modulate their physical, chemical, and mechanical

properties in response to changes in external stimuli or local physiological environment (Fig. 1.2) [14,15]. Advances in polymer synthesis, protein engineering, molecular self-assembly, and microfabrication technologies have made producing these next-generation biomaterials possible. These biomaterials can respond to a variety of physical, chemical, and biological cues such as temperature, sound, light, humidity, redox potential, pH, and enzyme activity [16,17]. Other unique characteristics displayed by some smart biomaterials are self-healing or shape-memory behavior [18]. The development of biomaterials with highly tunable properties has been driven by the desire to replicate the structure and function of extracellular matrix (ECM). Such materials can enable control of chemical and mechanical properties of the engineered tissue, including stiffness, porosity, cell attachment sites, and water uptake. For hydrogels, use of reversible cross
linking through physical methods, self-assembly, or thermally induced polymer chain entanglement is creating hydrogels that undergo structural changes in response to external stimuli [19,20]. Another class of hydrogels that are recent developments is called self-healing and shear thinning hydrogels. These materials are now being used to develop injectable biomaterials, which have low viscosity during application (injection) due to shear thinning and once at their target site, they self-crosslink (or heal) to fill the defect site [21]. Injectable biomaterials are also often loaded with drugs, biologics, and cells. For example, Montgomery et al. created an injectable shapememory biomaterial for minimally invasive delivery of functional tissues [22]. In other applications, tissue glues are being developed using smart biomaterials, where they are used to bond and allow the tissue to self-heal. An example of this approach is a study by Bhagat and Becker

who created a chondroitin-based tissue glue that helps direct improved tissue repair [23]. The ECM is a complex and dynamic structural scaffold for cells within tissues and plays an important role in regulating cell function [1]. Given the role of the ECM in structural support of tissues, there has been significant effort in developing ECM-based scaffolds for TE and RM [24,25]. However, as with all materials implanted into the body, the immune response significantly influences the ability of scaffold-containing engineered tissues to integrate and functionally interact with the host [26]. Thus an emerging strategy in TE is to design materials that can directly control the host immune response [27]. For example, the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) of ECM proteins can exert immunomodulatory effects on both innate and adaptive immune cells while also having an inhibitory effect on phagocytosis and neutrophil chemotaxis [28]. In the context of TE, synthetic ECM-mimetic hydrogels containing the RGD sequence have been shown to cause increased cellular adhesion on polymer scaffolds and also have an antiinflammatory effects from macrophages [29,30]. Under certain conditions, the RGD peptides have also been found to effect cytokine secretion from T cells [31]. Therefore use of RGD as part of TE scaffolds or hydrogels can be used to enhance cells adhesion in addition to controlling the ability of macrophages to degrade and remodel the surrounding tissue environment. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteases that not only selective degrade a wide variety of ECM proteins but also interact with bioactive molecules, some of which have immunomodulatory effects [32,33]. So, another strategy to control the extent of matrix remodeling, integration of engineered tissues into native host tissues or invasion of immune cell into implanted materials could be by incorporating MMP-sensitive peptides into the TE constructs. Examples of this approach include studies by Patterson and Hubbell, who showed that the rate of scaffold material degradation depends on the MMP-sensitive peptide sequence, the type of MMP, and also the MMP concentrations [34]. In a separate study, West and Hubbell created biomimetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels that incorporated peptides that could be degraded by either a fibrinolytic protease (plasmin) or a fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1) [35,36]. One drawback of this using MMP-sensitive peptides in TE constructs is their immunogenicity and more work will be needed to get around this issue. Possibly, use of immunomodulatory domains along with MMP-sensitive peptides could support long-term viability and integration within native host tissues. Another category of smart biomaterials is multidomain peptides (MDPs) hydrogels. These are injectable ECM mimetic materials that are engineered to form selfassembling meshes at the target site [37,38]. These MDPs
can also control cellular behavior. For example, in a mouse study by Moore et al., MDPs alone were found to be biocompatible and had prohealing effects in vivo [39]. Hydrogel have also been prepared from multiple ECM mimetic peptides for the purpose of enhancing the viability of the biomaterial in vivo. Smart biomaterials are going to have a big impact on 3D printing of tissues and organs. By combining smart biomaterials with 3D bioprinting, a wide variety of architectures can be created which can further offer control over how these materials perform in a biological environments. Smart biomaterials can also be made from proteins. Some protein protein interactions can be utilized to physically crosslink protein chains, while small coiled-coil domains within some proteins (called leucine zippers) can self-assemble into superhelical structures. Leucine zippers have been used to make hydrogels by physically crosslinking protein domains [40]. The stability of the leucine zipper selfassembly (and hence the hydrogel) can be controlled by changing the temperature. Another way to control the stability of some protein-based hydrogels is by arrangement of the interacting domains [41]. One drawback of hydrogels made of self-interacting protein domains is their low-to-moderate mechanical properties, which is not ideal for TE applications. However, these week interactions can be reinforced by introducing covalent bonds into the network (e.g., disulfide bonds between cysteine in the protein chains). This will not only improve the mechanical properties of the hydrogel but also its stability [42].
Cell sources
For TE, a variety of cell types are now being used. They include autologous, allogeneic, progenitors, adult unipotent or multipotent stem cells and iPSCs (Fig. 1.3). For some applications, the ability to expand a sufficient number of autologous cells from a small biopsy is wellestablished [44]. A good example is bladder augmentation, where smooth muscle and urothelium can be easily isolated from then native tissue, expanded in culture and used for engineering a new bladder tissue. However, in many cases, it is challenging to harvest and/or expand enough appropriate autologous cells for this purpose. Examples of such cell types include hepatocytes, kidney cells, insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, cardiomyocytes, neurons. New sources or methods to obtain these cell types in quantities can advance engineering of these tissues/organs and significantly benefit treatment of associated diseases. Immature precursor cells present within tissue such as skin, cartilage, muscle, and bladder are essential for the expansion of corresponding cells from biopsies and enabling engineering of neo-tissues [45]. The extension of this approach to other tissue and organ

systems will depend greatly on finding sources of appropriate stem and progenitor cells. Three major stem-cell sources are currently under intensive investigation:
1. embryonic stem (ES) cells, which are derived from discarded human embryos, and the equivalent embryonic germ (EG) cells; 2. iPSCs derived by genetic reprograming of somatic cells; and 3. Autologous or allogeneic adult tissue stem cells (sourced from fetal, neonatal, pediatric, or adult donor tissue).
Shared features of all stem cells include their capacity self-renewal and their ability to give rise to particular classes of differentiated cells. The ES, EG, and iPSCs can serve as precursors for many specialized cell type found during normal development and therefore are pluripotent. Adult stem cells are generally restricted to limited sets of cell lineages, hence called unipotent (constrained to a single fate) or multipotent (can give rise to multiple cell types). It appears likely that multiple tissue-engineered products based on each class of stem-cell source will be tested in the clinic in the coming years. Previous clinical and commercial experience sheds light on key differences between personalized products containing autologous cells and off-the-shelf products containing allogeneic cells. The vast majority of human studies till date have focused on using either adult stem or progenitor cells. More recently, clinical trials have begun with tissueengineered products derived from pluripotent stem cells and their future looks promising.
The first clinical tissue-engineered products to achieve marketing approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were skin substitutes that were used for wound healing. Examples of such products include Dermagraft (Shire Regenerative Medicine Inc., CT, United States) and Apligraf (Organogenesis, MA, United States), which were off-the-shelf products that used cells (fibroblasts for Dermagraft and fibroblasts plus keratinocytes for Apligraf) expanded from donated human foreskins. Whereas fibroblasts have been cultured in vitro since the early 20th century, the successful large-scale culture of human keratinocytes represented an important breakthrough for RM [46]. The success of off-the-shelf skin substitutes can be attributed to the lack of antigenpresenting cells, because of which they were not acutely rejected despite the inevitable histocompatibility mismatches between donors and recipients [47,48]. Eventually, the cells in the skin substitutes could be rejected, but the grafts has enough time for patients’ own skin cells to regenerate. This stands in contrast to standard tissue/organ transplantation in which immune rejection is a major concern and immunosuppressive drug therapy is generally part of the application of allogeneic grafts [49]. Tissue-engineered products based on harvesting and expanding autologous cells containing stem and/or progenitor populations have also been developed successfully. Prominent examples include Epicel (Genzyme, MA, United States), a permanent skin replacement product based on expanded keratinocytes for patients with lifethreatening burns, and Carticel (Genzyme, MA, United States), a chondrocyte-based treatment for large articular cartilage lesions [50,51].

Embryonic stem cells
ES cells and EG cells are indeed quite similar to early germ cells, with an apparently unlimited self-renewal capacity and pluripotency. Their great degree of plasticity represents both a strongest virtue and a significant potential limitation to their use in TE. A major ongoing challenge is in efficiently obtaining pure populations of specific desired specialized cell types from human ES cells [52,53]. Efforts during recent years have yielded more robust methods to isolate and grow ES cells under conditions consistent with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and to generate differentiated cell products. While initial efforts have focused on cell therapies, these advances will positively impact production of tissueengineered constructs using ES cells. Human ES cells are considerably more difficult to isolate and maintain stably in culture than the cell types that have previously been used in clinical testing. However, they can now be derived, grown, and cryopreserved without exposure to nonhuman cells or proteins, even under a GMP environment [54,55]. In the future, use of bioreactors, microcarriers, along with improved xeno-free and serum-free media and possibly small molecules that inhibit spontaneous differentiation of these cells would facilitate expansion of these stem cells to population sizes that are normally required for product development and clinical application [56,57]. Human tissues include more than 200 distinct cell types, and ES cells, in principle, can give rise to all of them. The historical approach of allowing ES cells to differentiate spontaneously has now been supplanted. Current strategies employ staged differentiation guided by knowledge of signaling events that regulate normal embryonic development [58]. For example, fine tuning of the exposure of early embryonic cells to the growth factor Nodal (a member of the transforming growth factor beta or TGF-β family) or its analog Activin A, in conjunction with other growth factors or small molecules, can now allow consistent generation of endoderm-specific cells from ES cells in vitro [59,60]. This is an early, but key milestone in a multistep process to generate differentiated cells that can eventually be used for TE of tissues/ organs like the liver and pancreas. Conversely, inhibition of Nodal/Activin signaling favors the production of ectoderm specific cells, a precursor for neural lineage cells [61]. Despite substantial challenges, the first ES-cellderived therapeutic product to enter clinical trials was the human ES-cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors (Geron Corporation; CA, United States) for stimulating nerve process growth in subjects with spinal cord injury [62]. Similarly, ES-cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium cells (Advanced Cell Technology, now Astellas
Institute for Regenerative Medicine; CA, United States) were used in clinical trials in patients to treat Stargardt’s macular dystrophy and dry age-related macular degeneration. Encouraging results from such clinical studies using ES cell-derived product will have a positive impact to develop tissue-engineered products from pluripotent stem cells in the near future. Areas of clear unmet medical need that might benefit from stem-cell-derived products include type 1 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. For type 1 diabetes, research at a biotech company called Viacyte Inc. (CA, United States) similarly pursued the produced progenitors of pancreatic endocrine cells from human ES cells using growth factors and hormones [63]. The progenitor cells from the final-stage differentiation in vitro were able to mature further in vivo to yield glucoseresponsive β-like cells [64]. As a potential therapy for Parkinson’s disease, significant advances have been made in the production of functional midbrain dopaminergic neurons by staged differentiation from ES cells [65,66]. Studies in the past few years have demonstrated that efficient grafting of these cells can lead to physiological correction of symptoms in several animal models, including nonhuman primates [67]. A particular safety concern is that undifferentiated pluripotent ES and iPS cells form teratomas in vivo. The risk of tumorigenicity makes it essential to rigorously determine the residual level of undifferentiated stem-cell population in any therapeutic product derived from ES or iPS cells [68]. It will also be valuable to determine whether a small number of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells can be introduced into human patients without significant risk of tumor growth and if this threshold is influenced by use of immune suppressive drugs during treatment.
Induced pluripotent stem cells
Theoretically, the development of iPSCs represent the most direct way to ensure immune compatibility of tissue-engineered products when the recipient themselves serve as the donor. Generation of iPSCs through reprograming of mature somatic cells to a pluripotent state was first accomplished by ectopic expression of four transcription factors: OCT4 and SOX2, both with KLF4 and cMYC [69] or NANOG and LIN28 [70]. The resulting iPSCs closely resembled ES cells in key properties such as the capacity for extensive self-renewal, ability to differentiate to multiple cell lineages, and generation of teratomas in vivo. Initial studies on reprograming of fibroblasts soon were extended to a variety of other cell types such as peripheral blood cells [71], cord blood cells [72], keratinocytes from hair shafts [73], and urinederived cells [74]. Many recent developments have advanced this reprograming technology toward a safer, efficient translation toward therapeutic products. Also,

improved methods to deliver the pluripotency factors can minimize the risk of unintended permanent genetic modification of iPSCs, particularly integration of an oncogene such as c-MYC and thereby decrease the potential for future tumorigenicity [75]. One approach is being pursued for this is to transiently deliver the factors using various nonintegrating viral or plasmid vector systems. Reprograming also can be achieved by direct delivery of either synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the pluripotency factors or of the protein factors themselves [76]. A recent development in the cellular reprograming field has centered on efforts to bypass the circuitous route of resetting cells to a pluripotent ground state and then inducing them to a desired lineage. Instead, there are efforts to achieve directed “trans-differentiation” between cell lineages. A number of studies have reported that fibroblasts or other adult cells can potentially be reprogramed directly to various specialized cell types such as neural progenitors [77], cardiomyocytes [78], endothelial cells [79], and hepatocytes [80]. However, there are still many queries about direct lineage-to-lineage reprogramming must be addressed. Some of these include the following questions: do the differentiated cells accurately mimic the genetic and functional characteristics of the target cells, or is there residual signatures of the original cells? Do the differentiated cells display fully adult phenotypes? Is the risk of introducing unwanted genetic or epigenetic abnormalities less or greater than in reprogramming through a pluripotent state? The answers to these questions will clarify the value of direct cell lineage conversions and the future of this approach for TE and RM applications.
Adult stem cells
Despite the promise of ES and iPSCs for TE and RM, the challenges of controlling lineage-specific differentiation, eliminating residual pluripotent stem cells, and confirming the safety and phenotype accuracy of then final products will likely delay the clinical translation and regulatory approval of such products. By contrast, adult stem cells represent a more straight-forward approach to rapid clinical development of cell-based and tissueengineered products. Adult stem cells are present in many tissues throughout fetal development and postnatal life and are committed to restricted cell lineages [81,82]. Also, intrinsically they are not tumorigenic. At present, the most commonly used adult stem cells for development of cell therapy and TE applications are bone marrowderived mesenchymal stromal or stem cells (MSC). MSCs can give rise to a number of tissue types, including cartilage, bone, adipose, and some types of muscle [83]. MSC have also generated considerable interest for
musculoskeletal and vascular TE [84,85]. An advantage of using MSCs is that they can be easily harvested from liposuction specimens. An unexpected discovery that is further benefitting the use of MSCs for RM is then observation that they can be readily transplanted into allogeneic recipients without significant immune rejection [86]. This ability to avoid acute immune rejection in the host results from a variety of mechanisms, most notably the secretion of antiinflammatory cytokines [87]. Recent clinical trials have also assessed MSC-based cell therapy to treat graft versus host disease (GvHD) and various inflammatory or autoimmune conditions [88,89]. In fact, the first regulatory approvals for sale of a bone marrowderived MSC product (Prochymal; Osiris Therapeutics; MD, United States) was for treatment of GvHD. The therapeutic benefits of MSCs can also be through secretion of trophic factors. This has been seen in MSCbased cell therapy for heart disease, where delivery of autologous or allogeneic cells into the left ventricle wall for treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy in a large animal model or even human clinical trials showed induction of new cardiomyocytes from endogenous cardiac stem and progenitor cells through trophic effects [90]. The injected MSCs also apparently contribute to positive remodeling of damaged heart tissue long after the initial damage [91]. Another study has demonstrated that combined delivery of MSCs with adult cardiac stem cells can substantially improves outcomes in the porcine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy [92]. This interesting result can be translated to generating improved tissue-engineered cardiac constructs by incorporating both the above stem cell types. Treatment of neurodegenerative conditions remains a challenge. Several years ago a company called Stem Cells Inc. (CA, United States) carried out clinical studies using a brain-derived neural stem-cell preparation called human central nervous system stem cells (HuCNSSC), in a handful of subjects with neurological degenerative conditions referred to as neuronal lipoid fuscinosis (Batten’s Disease) and Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease [93]. Study data, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demonstrated the durable engraftment of these cells and suggested that they contributed to myelination in recipient’s brain tissue. The same company later began clinical trials using the same neural-derived stem cell in human subjects with dry age-related macular degeneration and spinal cord injuries. Hepatic stem cells (HpSC) represent another human adult stem-cell population that can gives rise to parenchymal cells within tissues and organs [94]. The HpSCs are isolated from the liver and can be enriched from cadaveric fetal, neonatal, or fully mature donors by selection with a monoclonal antibody to the surface marker CD326. Exposure to certain growth factors (such as epidermal growth factor or EGF) or different tissue-specific matrix
Tissue engineering: current status and future perspectives Chapter | 1 7


molecules (such as liver proteoglycans) can induce efficient differentiation of the HpSC to either hepatocytes or cholangiocytes (bile duct cells) [95]. An early clinical study for the assessment of CD326-positive hepatic stem and progenitor cells on 25 subjects with decompensated liver cirrhosis found that delivery of these cells to the liver was best achieved by infusion via the hepatic artery. Also, at 6 months postinfusion, improvements in a number of clinical parameters were noted, including a significant decrease in the mean Mayo End-stage Liver Disease score (P , .01). Another clinical study with HpSC transplantation achieved encouraging results using allogeneic donors, no human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci matching, and without the use of immune suppressive drugs [94]. It is conceivable that HpSC (and possibly other fetal liver-derived stem cells) are particularly nonimmunogenic because they express only low levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and lack detectable MHC Class II (similar to ES cells). In addition, the liver is significantly immune privileged with respect to transplant rejection. Another hypothesis for this immune privilege could be that since this particular HpSC population were are isolated by immune-selection using antibody-coated beads specific for CD326, some angioblast-like mesenchymal cells could have copurified. Angioblast-like mesenchymal cells, just like MSC, are known to secrete immunomodulatory factors that could protect the HpSC and differentiated cells derived from them against immune rejection in the liver. A new source of human adult stem-cell population, which can be used for engineering of pancreatic islet like structures to treat insulin-dependent diabetes, was identified in peribiliary glands (found in the extrahepatic biliary tree located between the liver and pancreas) [95,96]. Molecular characterization of these biliary tree stem cells suggests that they comprise a population of endodermal stem cells that are more primitive than HpSC identified within the liver. Some of these biliary tree stem cells do not express CD326 but appear to be precursors of the CD326-positive HpSC. The biliary tree stem cells can proliferate extensively when cultured in the serum-free defined medium developed for HpSC.
Whole organ engineering
Tissue and organ failure is currently one of the biggest health issues, whose treatment is still an unmet medical need. This problem is ever increasing, with more than 100,000 patients being on the organ donor waiting lists in the United States alone [97]. Lack of sufficient organ donors and availability of healthy tissues and organs are further complicating this situation. TE is providing hope in this direction, with many efforts directed toward
bioengineering tissues and even whole organs [98]. Decellularized tissues are gaining popularity as scaffolds for TE. These are prepared by removing cells from original tissues using mild detergents [99], after which they can be processed into different forms such as blocks, or powder for use. These decellularized materials represent the ECM of tissue from which they are derived and consist mainly of collagen. Since the shape, size, and complex structural properties of the native tissue are also maintained, decellularized tissue represent the ideal scaffolds for TE. Decellularization can be performed using chemical, physical/ mechanical, or combination methods. Chemical methods include use of mild surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium deoxycholate, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, Triton X-100, tridecylalcohol ethoxylate, and acid/bases such as per-acetic acid [100]. Physical/mechanical methods for decellularization are used in situations where there are concerns regarding the possible toxicity of the chemicals and nondesirable destruction of ECM proteins. Physical/mechanical treatments include the use of high hydrostatic pressure, freeze thaw, or super-critical carbon dioxide (CO2). The decellularization strategy is being used for TE to treat hernia repair [98,101], periodontal tissue [102], tendon [103], bone [104], vasculature [105], uterine tissue [106], heart valves [107], etc. Recent advancements in decellularized tissue research have resulted in successful decellularization of whole organs for whole organ reconstruction. Examples include liver [108], kidney [109], lung [110], and heart [111]. Clinical applications of decellularized ECM-based scaffolds are also on the rise. However, they have been limited to engineering of less complex tissues related to structural or reconstructive applications. It is noteworthy that many of the FDA-approved products on the market are derived from xenogeneic or allogeneic decellularized tissue ECM. Examples include SynerGraft for repair of human pulmonary heart valve (CryoLife; GA, United States), AlloDerm Regenerative Tissue Matrix (human dermal graft; LifeCell Corp, now Allergen, NJ, United States), and Meso BioMatrix Surgical Mesh (DSM Biomedical; PA, United States). Clinical trials have also been carried out using more complex structures made from decellularized ECM-scaffolds. One examples is a tissue-engineered trachea [112], which had long-term patency (at least 5 years posttransplantation), was completely cellularized and vascularized and did not provoke a significant immunogenic response [113]. Sometimes, the decellularization process can damage certain critical components needed for new tissue formation, such as endothelial basement membrane of the vasculature. In such cases, a practical strategy would be to add synthetic materials to promote functions. For
8 CHAPTER | 1 Tissue engineering: current status and future perspectives


example, some researchers have used the immobilization of anticoagulants, such as peptides [114] or heparin [115], to the endothelium of the decellularized vessel to prevent blood coagulation inside the blood vessels during the regeneration process. A new avenue in decellularized tissue research is use of a device that links native tissues to synthetic materials. Here the decellularized tissue acts as an intermediate material, and then linking device ensures compatibility between the native tissue and synthetic materials at the molecular level. An example for this approach preparation of a decellularized skin dermis and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) complex by immersing the decellularized dermis in methyl methacrylate monomers, followed by polymerization [116]. Testing showed that this composite elasticity similar to the skin dermis, while the compressive modulus value was between that of the dermis and PMMA.
Biofabrication technologies
Biofabrication combines the principles of engineering, material science, and biology. It is a great toolbox that promise to change the outcome of many biomedical disciplines, particularly TE and RM. In addition, it also holds great potential for development of physiological 3D in vitro models, where complex tissue constructs are created that have a high degree of structural and functional similarities to native tissues. For TE, the most commonly used biofabrication technologies include (1) electrospinning; (2) drop-on-demand technologies such as ink-jet 3D bioprinting; (3) fused deposition modeling technologies such as extrusion-based 3D bioprinting; and (4) lightbased technologies such as stereolithography (SLA) and laser-assisted bioprinting [117] (Fig. 1.4). Recent trends in electrospinning, inkjet printing, and extrusion-based 3D bioprinting are discussed next:
Electrospinning
Electrospinning refers to a technique for fabricating fibrous scaffolds [121] (Fig. 1.4B). The advantages of electrospinning as a scaffold fabrication technique include simple setup, versatility, and relative low-cost, which has supported use in TE applications, from skin grafts to vascular grafts to drug delivery devices [122 125]. For TE, a wide range of fiber architectures have been created, from scaffolds with uniform fibers to fibers with gradient properties, fibers with core shell morphology, and scaffolds with patterned fiber depositions [126,127]. This has enabled researchers to create complex TE strategies to better mimic in vivo tissue structure and function. In spite of the several advantages of electrospun fibers and their scaffolds, one inherent limitation is the relatively poor cellular infiltration into the depth of these scaffold. This
can happen due to high-fiber packing densities resulting in small and uneven pore sizes. Recent approaches in the field of electrospinning that have tried to address these limitations and expand the use of electrospun scaffolds in TE include use of postprocessing procedures and sacrificial components [128,129]. Some recent developments in electrospinning include modification of the electrospinning setup, new electrospinning processes, and new methods to achieve complex mesh composition and architectures (Table 1.1). Modification of the electrospinning setup have been carried out to provide better fiber orientation, control of fiber blending or cospinning, and targeted fiber collection. Examples include use of a rotating mandrel [130], gap electrospinning [131], and magnetic electrospinning [132,133]. The description of these methods and their specific advantages are listed in Table 1.1. In the past decade, a variety of new electrospinning processes have been developed with the aim of generating more varied and complex fiber geometries. Prominent among these methods are coaxial electrospinning [134], fiber blending [135,136], emulsion electrospinning [137,138], and edge electrospinning [139,140]. The description of the new electrospinning processes and specific advantages of each are listed in Table 1.1. In coaxial electrospinning, since the fiber generation process occurs rapidly, there is no possibility of any mixing of the core and shell polymers. Examples of electrospinning using fiber blending include creation of a polyurethane (PU)-gelatin bicomponent fibrous scaffold for wound dressing applications [146] and formation of an RGD peptide cell-adhesive gradient through the depths of a scaffold to direct cellular migration [147]. Fiber blending represents a future area of advancement for electrospinning and its use in creating more in vivo like scaffolds. Emulsion electrospinning is mainly used for delivery applications, where drugs, enzymes, growth factors, etc., are often emulsified within hydrophobic polymers, so that their bioactivity is retained and sustained release can be achieved [137,138]. To address the issue of speed (electrospinning is a slow process), a method called edge electrospinning [139,140] has been developed. An examples is a study by Thoppey et al. who used edge electrospinning of polycaprolactone and saw an increase in the production rate by about 40 folds [140]. New electrospinning methods that have been designed to achieve complex mesh composition and architectures include coelectrospinning [141.142], hydrospinning [143], and 3D electrospinning [144,145]. One example of coelectrospinning is when a natural polymer is used along with a synthetic polymer, the cellular behavior and the mechanical properties of the resulting scaffold can be independently controlled by altering the weight ratio of each material [142]. Examples of hydrospinning include a study where

scaffolds with high porosity were created that allowed for better cellular infiltration [143] and another where anisotropic scaffolds with layers that altered in alignment were created for better tendon TE [148]. Examples of 3D electrospinning include fabrication of interconnected tubes with different structures and patterns [144] and reconstruction of outer ear using an ear-shaped collector to generate the scaffolds [145]. Achieving optimum cellular infiltration within electrospun scaffolds has been a challenge and an intrinsic limitation of the electrospinning method. A variety of methods that are being developed to improve cellular infiltration and direct their behavior within electrospun scaffolds include variations of the electrospinning process (as discussed above), use of postprocessing procedures, and incorporation of biochemical cues.
Another way to decrease packing density and increase pore size within electrospun scaffolds is by using sacrificial components during coelectrospinning [149,150]. After fabrication, the sacrificial component is removed by treating the scaffold with an aqueous solution. Postelectrospinning processing (postprocessing) of the scaffolds is another practical way to enhance cellular penetration. Postprocessing methods include use of laser ablation to pattern pores into the scaffold [151], use of a metal comb to separate fibers after the electrospinning [152], and used of ultrasonic energy to mechanically agitate fibers immersed in a liquid [153]. Till now, the most effective method to enhance cellular infiltration within electrospun scaffolds has been the use of dynamic cell culture. Dynamic cell cultures have been achieved for this purpose by using either simple setups such as an orbital

shaker [154] or a complex system such as a flow perfusion bioreactor [155].
Inkjet three-dimensional bioprinting
3D bioprinting is a process in which biomaterials or biomaterials combined with cells are deposited in predefined patterns, layer-by-layer using a bottom-up assembly approach to create a 3D biological structure [8]. This technology is making it possible to recapitulate the structure, composition, and complexity of human tissues and, ultimately, may lead toward whole organ engineering for clinical use. Inkjet 3D bioprinting is a method that uses droplets of inks (polymers, cells, or combinations of the two) to create 3D cellular or tissue structures (Fig. 1.4C). The first attempts to print live cells using then inkjet method was carried out using a modified commercially available inkjet printer [8]. However, due to severe limitations in that approach, special 3D printers were designed to dispense cells and biological materials into a desired pattern using droplets that were ejected via thermal or piezoelectric processes. The main advantages of inkjet printing is their high resolutions (5 50 μm), high cell viability, high print speeds, and low costs. However, there are problems too, including less control of droplet directionality, unreliable cell encapsulation due to the low viscosity of the ink material, restrictions on the viscosities of materials that can be used, and limitations of vertical printing. Some examples of tissue fabrications using inkjet include full thickness skin models with pigmentation [156], cardiac tissue with a beating cell response [157], neural tissue [158], and a bone-like tissue [159].
Extrusion three-dimensional bioprinting
Extrusion-based bioprinting is focused on the printing of biomaterials, cells, bioactive molecules, or combinations thereof by extruding continuous cylindrical filaments using pneumatic, piston-driven, or screw-assisted systems (Fig. 1.4C). This technology supports precise deposition of materials/cells and formation of complex 3D structures. Extrusion-based bioprinted structures have better structural integrity compared to inkjet-printed structures and can be used to form porous 3D scaffolds. The resolution that can be achieved with extrusion-based systems are relatively low as compared inkjet or laser-based systems, but anatomically shaped structures can best be generated using this technology. In the past several years, extrusionbased 3D bioprinting has been receiving considerable attention for creating artificial tissues or organs [160,161]. This technology has been supported by development of new bioink materials that can mimic many features of native ECMs while at the same time support cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation [162,163].
Extrusion-based bioprinting systems (bioprinters) rely on continuous dispensing of polymer and/or hydrogel filaments through a micro-nozzle (about 25 300 μm or larger pore diameter) and positioning them according to a 3D digital design file, via computer-controlled motion either of the printing heads or collecting stage or both. New technological advances in the past decade include development of advanced extrusion 3D bioprinters, such as the integrated tissue-organ printer (ITOP) at the Wake Forest Institute for RM [160]. The ITOP used clinical imaging data to print simple-to-complex human-scale tissue constructs using biomaterials, cell-laden hydrogels (bioinks), and a multinozzle extrusion system. Examples of tissues printed and implanted in vivo include bone, cartilage, skeletal muscle, cardiac tissue, skin, liver, kidney, bladder, lungs, and trachea. Another advancement was printing of micro-channels within tissue constructs that supported the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients to cells within the construct. Although many challenges still remain for 3D bioprinting of complex human organs, the ability to print using multiple materials and cells simultaneously and create human-sized constructs represents a significant progress in realizing the goal of TE. Another example of an advanced 3D bioprinting system is the one described by Liu et al. [164]. By combining seven capillaries in a single print head, each of which is connected to a different bioink reservoir, this bioprinter can extrude multiple bioinks in a continuous manner. In addition, each capillary can be individually actuated and controlled and fabrication of complex constructs is made possible by fast and smooth switching among different reservoirs. This 3D bioprinter addresses the limitations associated with conventional multihead printers where multimaterial printing can compromise fabrication speed, complexity, or both. Although this system requires further optimizations and validations, it is a good example of the type of disruptive technology needed to advance in the field of TE. For creating human size tissues, extrusion-based 3D bioprinting is the most suitable technique. The printing material forms an important component of this strategy, where they primarily provide cells with the right environment to proliferate, differentiate, and form tissues. Therefore a rational bioink design approach for specific applications will be crucial to the success of the bioprinting strategy. New trends in bioinks for 3D bioprinting include self-healing and shear-thinning hydrogels that are based on supramolecular assembly of nanoparticles, small molecules, or macromolecules. These materials have unique rheology and gelation properties, which can be tailored according to need and also the printing processes [165]. Such materials have been used before as injectable cell carriers and for cell encapsulation [166], but their use to formulate bioinks is a recent development.
12 CHAPTER | 1 Tissue engineering: current status and future perspectives


Examples include a study by Li et al. who have described a shear-thinning hydrogel based on a polypeptide DNA derivative [167]. Loo et al. have developed a peptide bioink using hexapeptides that self-assemble into stable nanofibrous hydrogels [168], while Schacht et al. developed a shear-thinning bioink hydrogels using recombinant spider silk proteins [169]. To produce 3D-printed cell-laden constructs, this spider silk proteins-based bioink does not require any additional components, while at the same time, it shows a good printing fidelity and cell compatibility. A hyaluronic acid (HA) bioink that crosslinks through supramolecular assembly is described by Burdick et al. [170]. This hydrogel displays shear-thinning and self-healing properties, where the hydrogel flows due to the shearing stress applied during the extrusion process, while after printing it rapidly solidifies without any further trigger. Further stability of these hydrogels can be increased by introducing methacrylates into the HA macromers, thereby allowing for printing of complex 3D structures or perfusable channel patterns without using any scaffolding materials. Further iterations to this HA bioink include a dual-crosslinking hydrogel system, where guest host bonding was followed by photopolymerization [171]. This new bioink formulation was also use to print stable 3D structures without using any scaffolding materials. Use of polymeric hydrogels for 3D bioprinting has attracted substantial attention in recent years due to their tunable properties and structural similarities to native ECM. Some of the polymers used to make hydrogels include PEG, polyesters, poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide), and polyphosphazenes [172]. The advantage of using synthetic polymers for making bioinks is that their physicochemical properties are more controllable compared to naturally derived polymers. Examples include bisilylated PEG-based hydrogels that can crosslink through Si O Si bond formation without need for any crosslinking agents [173]; a photocrosslinkable acrylated PEGfibrinogen based bioink that can form hydrogel networks through calcium-mediated ionotropic interactions and then photo-crosslinked [174]. Similarly, Lorson et al. have developed thermos-reversible supramolecular hydrogels and used them as bioinks [175]. Hybrid bioinks are a new trend in 3D bioprinting, where a biocompatible polymer is combined with a material that imparts unique properties to the bioink for a specific application. An example is a hybrid bioink made from PU and graphene oxide (GO), where the GO specifically supported the formation of neural tissues [176]. Recently, researchers have been developing decellularized ECM (dECM) as bioinks for 3D printing of tissue and organ structures. Similar to the decellularized tissues, the dECM-based bioinks can more accurately recapitulate the biochemical microenvironments of the native tissue
ECM compared to just using biomaterials [177]. Studies have shown that 3D-printed tissue made using dECMbased bioink support better cell proliferation, differentiation, maturation, and overall therapeutic effects in vivo after transplantation [178]. Examples of use of dECMbased bioinks for TE include fabrication of stemcell-laden cardiac tissue patches for the treatment of myocardial infarction models [179] and hepatic tissue for liver regeneration [180]. Research and development of dECM-based bioinks are work in progress and it would be interesting to see how further developments in this direction can help create structurally and functionally relevant tissues and organs. Nanotechnology has been making its way into several RM applications during the past decade [181]. Some of these nanotechnologies have been used in the field of biofabrication [182,183], such as in the nanocomposite bioinks (nanoinks) with tailored properties for specific applications. Examples include a bioactive DNA/HAcoated single-wall carbon nanotube (CNT)-based nanoink for printing two-dimensional (2D) and 3D flexible electronics [184]. Using a two-step process, 3D structures with conductive patterns were printed on several supports, including within hydrogels. Another example is the study by Lind et al., who 3D printed “cardiac organs-on-chip” using a combination of thermoplastic PU filled with carbon black nanoparticles (conductive inks) with other inks [185]. The printed structures within then chip conferred various properties such as biocompatibility, high conductance, and piezoresistivity. Jakus et al. used nanoinks composed of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and graphene for printing 3D neuronal conduits that promote neural regeneration [186]. In addition to biocompatibility, neurogenic differentiation of the seeded human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was demonstrated on these materials along with formation of axons and presynapticlike terminals.
Spheroids and organoids
It is now well-known that 2D cell culture environment can make it difficult to control cell cell and cell substrate interactions in natural tissue, thereby presenting limitations in recreating biological and physiological features of human tissues and organs. To address this, researchers have developed different types of 3D scaffolds using natural and synthetic polymers. Hydrogels have been one of the most commonly used 3D scaffolds for cell culture and TE due to their high water content, ECM like microstructure and biocompatibility [187,188]. However, use of simple hydrogels could not fully recreate the complex microenvironment of many higher order tissues and organs. One of the basic question being asked today in TE is how precisely the physical, chemical, and biological

properties (if applicable) of a 3D scaffold can support or regulate cell function. The regulation of the hydrogel environment is a promising method for controlling cellular behavior in three dimensions. One example of such an approach is a study by Caballero et al., who used a pattern with microgrooves to engineer anisotropic fibroblast-derived matrices [189]. Fibroblasts seeded into this matrix showed in vivo like phenotype such as alignment, spreading, and migration. In another study, Trappmann et al. devised a way to control the swelling of a dextran hydrogel by attaching a methacrylate (a hydrophobic pendant group) to dextran (the hydrophilic polymer chain in then hydrogel) and found that the swelling of these hydrogels could be reduced from 55% to 0% (no swelling) [190]. In addition, insertion of a di-cysteine peptide sequence allowed for a partial degradation of the hydrogel through cleavage by MMP that also supported endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Success of such approaches provides support to more innovations in 3D cell culture and tissue biofabrication, all of which will be advancing then field of TE in the coming years. Among 3D culture systems, cellular spheroids have been attracting more attention lately. These are 3D complexes composed only of cells, where the spheroid is formed based on the self-assembling tendencies of these cells [191]. Cell spheroids offer several advantages over 2D cell cultures, including better cell cell interactions and diffusive mass transport. Therefore they can not only be used for investigations of physiological and developmental processes but also as building blocks for TE (Fig. 1.5). For TE, spheroids of multiple cellular origins can be combined or multiple cell types can be incorporated in a single spheroid using coculture. They are produced using a variety of devices such as microwell or
hanging drop plates. However, spheroids made this way have features that are somewhat different from the structure of the native tissues. To address this, new ways of spheroid generation are being explored. One example is using phosphoproteins and glycoproteins to generate supramolecular nanofibrils and then induce self-assembly of fibroblasts [193]. Spheroids produced this way had a more tissue-like form. In another study, fragmented nanofibers as a physical artificial support were injected into the spheroids to control cell function [194]. In addition, using this approach, the researchers could create larger spheroids (B800-mm diameter) compared to the spheroids that were made only of cells. Another example of spheroids application is for studying the physical stimuli that may occur within tissues. Dolega et al. measured mechanical stress within spheroids by injecting an ultrafine polyacrylamide microbeads as a pressure sensor [195]; while Cho et al. made multicellular spheroids composed of human brain vascular pericytes, primary human astrocytes, and human brain microvascular endothelial cells in agarose gel and used it for blood brain barrier studies [196]. Applications of cellular spheroids include cancer research, disease modeling, and in vitro platforms for drug/toxicity testing. Although spheroids have been around for more than 10 years, their application for TE has not been common. One reason is that they are primarily used for mimicking microniches, plus the control of spheroids during culturing has been an issue. Also, if a spheroid is larger than a certain size, necrosis occurs in the core, thereby reducing their usefulness for mimicking structurally complex and multicellular tissues. However, the regenerative potential and fusion capacity of these spheroids can be improved by in vitro preconditioning or by incorporation of biomaterial components. Fusing them

together can generate scaffold-free macro-tissues, while seeding them on scaffolds can generate in vivo like engineered tissues. A more complex spheroid type are 3D tissue organoids. An organoid is an extended cellular spheroid that has a physicochemical environment very similar to the tissue it is representing. The generation of organoids can be considered as one of the major technological breakthroughs of the past decade. Organoids can be generated using different cell sources (such as autologous cells, ES cells, iPSCs) and self-organization or fabrication methods (hanging drop plates, ultralow attachment plates, agarosecoated plates, or ECM surface culture) (Fig. 1.6A and B). Organoids can display various biological features seen in vivo, such as tissue organization, regeneration, responses to drugs, or damage. Examples of some of the tissue-specific organoids that have been developed include liver [200,201], lung [202], pancreas [203], prostrate [204], intestine [205], heart [206], brain [199]. The development organoids representing the nervous system had been a challenge so far. However, recently, Birey et al. successfully fabricated human subpallium and
human cortical spheroids [207]. They showed that γ-aminobutyric-acid-releasing (GABAergic) neurons could migrate from the ventral to the dorsal forebrain and integrate into cortical circuits. Success of such efforts provide confidence that it is possible to create micro-tissues that can more closely mimic structure and physiological aspects of complex tissues. 3D bioprinting has become a popular way of creating engineered tissues to be used both for studying the basic tissue biology or pathology and for repair or regeneration in vivo. A recent application of 3D bioprinted tissue is for toxicity testing, drug screening, and development with the aim of reducing or eliminating the use of animals for these purposes. Many types of tissues are being 3D bioprinted for in vitro use. One interesting example is a multicellular 3D hepatic tissue by Chen et al., who used methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) and glycidyl methacrylated HA, with human iPSCs, adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as the bioink to print microscale hexagonal architectures that mimicked the native hepatic microenvironment [208]. In addition to better morphological

organization, this 3D-printed liver also showed increased metabolic secretion, enhanced cytochrome-P450 induction, and higher liver-specific gene expression.
Imaging technologies
Multiscale digital imaging data is becoming a critical part of many TE strategies that are aiming to recreate complex tissues and organs. These digital data act as blueprints upon which design and fabrication strategies of neotissues and neo-organs are based. A great deal of anatomical data already exists, for example, in the many medical computed tomography (CT) and MRI images, which can be harnessed for generating 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models of implants and tissues for biofabrication. Recent advances in bioimaging are also allowing for collection of data to create high-resolution designs for TE. For example, CLARITY is a technique by which the lipid content of tissues are removed, leaving behind a transparent, porous hydrogels like tissue which maintains the original intact structures [209,210]. This technique can be used to visualize a tissue’s structure and molecular composition at very high resolutions (as high as 70 nm) [211]. In addition, the ever increasing repertoire of MRI, contrast-enhanced nanotomography (nano-CT), histological data (including immunohistochemistry), and molecular imaging are providing large-scale structural information as well as fine molecular-level information (such as distribution and interaction of cells through a tissue or organ). Such information can be used to design multiphasic structures that have both structural and biochemical heterogeneity and in vivo like organization.
Tissue neovascularization
Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are two basic and critical processes by which vasculature forms during development. For tissue and organ bioengineering, attempts are now being made to recreate these processes to generate vascular networks [212]. In bioengineered tissues, the diffusion limit of oxygen is typically 100 200 μm and thicker tissue without an intact vasculature for oxygen and nutrient transport will face necrosis. In addition to creating structural vessels, vascular engineering designs will also have to ensure normal cellular metabolism within these structures, be permeable to allow extravasation of cells, maintain an open-vessel lumen during remodeling, and also promote integration with the host vasculature [213]. Efforts are underway in this direction, which include a study by Lewis et al., who 3D printed a cell-laden, thick ( . 1 cm), vascularized connective tissues that could be perfused and sustained in culture for .6 weeks [214]. The 3D vascular networks were created using a pluronic fugitive ink and the vessels were lined
with HUVECs and MSCs. To demonstrate the functionality of then vasculature, osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs within the construct was induced by osteogenic media delivered through the vasculature. In addition to highlighting the importance of a functional vasculature for engineering thick tissues, this study also provides a design platform to build other tissues with functional vasculature. Jia et al. demonstrated an alternative method to 3D print vascular networks, one that does not use sacrificial inks [215]. Here, a newly designed multilayered coaxial nozzle device was used to 3D bioprint perfusable vascular channels using a specially designed cell-responsive bioink. Printing was carried out using a trilayered coaxial nozzle, while the bioink contained sodium alginate, gelatin methacryloyl, and four-arm poly(ethylene glycol)tetra-acrylate. A multistep crosslinking process, followed by removal of the alginate using Ca21 resulted in creation of a layered, perfusable hollow tubes. Although long-term perfusability of this construct was an issue, this approach represents an advancement over the conventional strategies to engineer vasculature in tissue constructs. Anastomosis of prevascularized 3D tissues with host vasculature are also being investigated. Examples include studies by Zhu et al., who 3D printed tissues where GelMA polymer was used along with mesenchymal cells and HUVECs to form hydrogel networks representing vasculature by photo-crosslinking [118]. On in vivo implantation, anastomosis between the host circulation and the prevascular tissues construct was observed where blood vessel growth were seen into the construct having red blood cells. For bone TE, prevascularized bone scaffolds were generated using bioactive bioinks, as described by Kuss et al. [216]. To from then vascular networks, GelMA and acrylated HA with HUVECs and human adipose-derived MSCs were used. In vitro studies showed that the prevascularized construct generated more capillary-like structures when compared to nonprevascularized tissue, and when implantation in vivo in mice, anastomosis with host vasculature was observed along with microvessel and lumen formation.
Bioreactors
Bioreactors are critical for engineering new tissues. They are used to recapitulate physiological environments in which cells exist in vivo: expand cells for potential clinical use, to test potential new treatments in an in vivo like environments, and to establish new therapeutic targets. Significant improvements in design and construction of bioreactors have been made over the past decade. Some of these systems can support growth of whole tissues of 3D bioengineered constructs, coculture of cells of different phenotypes, generate dynamic culture

conditions which facilitates mass transfer, and have advanced sensors and imaging capabilities allowing for real-time monitoring of physiological parameters. Whilst more sophisticated bioreactor can more accurately recreate the complex cell/tissue microenvironments, they are challenging to create and operate. In contrast, simpler bioreactor designs can recreate only selected conditions but are more operationally robust. Therefore a compromise between complexities versus essential functionality needs to be determined based on the application and the desired end-product. Perfusion bioreactors are being used to closely simulate the in vivo environments for TE. In a perfusion bioreactor, the media flow is either cross, downwards, or in a specific pattern that generated some kind of microgravity environment. Fluidized bed bioreactors and ones with rotating wall can achieves greater mass transfers, which are beneficial to the tissue or organ being conditioned. In one study, using a rotatory cell culture system, Crabbe et al. [217] improve reseeding of decellularized lung tissue. However, if the flow in the bioreactor is not optimized, it can have negative effects. Other factors that can have important impact on tissues being cultures in bioreactors include the scaffold’s architecture, oxygenation, mechanical stimuli, and sheer stress. The design of the scaffold used for making the tissue construct will impact mass transfer during culture. The scaffold pore size not only affects the cell seeding but also distribution of nutrients and gas exchange during culture. Therefore the original scaffold design should take into consideration the thickness, pore size, and interconnectivity. In general, decellularized tissues are supposed to offer an ideal scaffold environment for TE, because they are derived from the same tissue they will be replacing. As for assisting cell seeding within scaffolds, some physical methods such as electromagnetism or acoustics have also been used [218,219]. In bioreactors where the culture media is the only nutrient source, the presence of a suitable oxygen tension is critical. Hence, balancing the oxygen environment should be an integral part of bioreactor design. Use of oxygen delivery agents such as perfluorocarbons [220] or artificial red blood cells can help create a balanced oxygen environment, while use of fluorescent oxygen sensors can help control this environment. Use of mechanical stimuli to condition cells and tissues in artificial environments has been done since a long time. The types of mechanical stimuli can include shear stress, compression, stretch, or pressure loads. With advances in bioreactor engineering, it is now possible to engineer such capabilities into the bioreactors. At the cellular level, these stimuli activate mechano-transduction cellular signaling pathways and causes changes such as focal adhesions, cell-to-cell contacts, and changes in gene expression. Cultured tissues such as blood vessels, muscles, and ligaments would need such stimuli to develop
into in vivo like tissues before implantation. For example, in cardiac tissues, mechanical stretch and/or electrical stimuli lead to synchronized contractions [221], while application of cyclic stretch in muscles enhances ECM protein content, among other things [222]. Shear stress in a dynamic environment may not represent the physiological state for some tissues and may impact their performance. An example is liver, where the hepatocytes are shielded from shear even though the blood flow through the portal vein at a rate of 1200 mL/min.
Organ-on-a-chip and body-on-a-chip
The continuous rise in drug development cost and increase in the number of drug candidates failing in clinical trials, despite promising results from traditional preclinical model systems, have prompted development of better physiologically relevant and predictive in vitro/ ex vivo systems. Therefore better and physiologically relevant in vitro models are needed that better predict drug efficacy and safety in humans and which can be used in a high-throughput way. More recently, the engineering of complex tissues in vitro has been supported by two integrated approaches: (a) organoids and (b) microfluidicsbased organ systems known as “organs-on-a-chip” or “body-on-a-chip” [223]. 3D organoids have been developed to recapture the phenomenon of controlled cell growth to appropriate length scales in three dimensions, which happens in body tissues. Use of organoids is now expanding beyond basic research to disease modeling, drug discovery/ development, and personalized medicine. Also, organoids can be easily integrated with chip models via microfluidics. The organoid-based “organs-on-a-chip” systems can surpass traditional “cells-in-a-dish” models with regards to recapitulating in vivo structural and physiological microenvironments [224]. Furthermore, different tissue-specific organoids can be connected in an integrated circuit format using microfluidics to create a “body-on-a-chip.” New technologies that are permitting development of complex biological systems with control over the physical and chemical microenvironment include microfluidics. Microfluidics can allow us to create 3D microphysiological systems, such as organs-on-a-chip or body-on-a-chip. These systems can allow us to study living tissues and organs in a more complex way. Microfluidics-based 3D multifunctional systems can also support cell and organoid cultures, where control of parameters such as nutrient low, oxygen gradients, and drug/biologics distribution can be used for accurate high-throughput testing and environment sampling applications. Microfluidic-based systems have contributed significant to the in vitro modeling of tissues such as heart [225], kidney [226], and blood brain barrier [227]. Here, well-defined cellular

environments closely mimic a physiological niche for better understanding of the biological mechanisms operating within that particular tissue. Recreating the highly complex structures of organs is a tremendous engineering challenge. A better way for studying the physiology, drug response, or chemical toxicity in a single organ or an organ system is to create miniaturized version of these organs that capture their functions. Organ-on-chip systems represent an effort in that direction. Using these systems, cell function can be quantitatively studied in response to precisely controlled physicochemical cues. A higher version of this is bodyon-chip, where multiple tissues representing different organs are placed on a single-chip format and interconnected by microfluidic channels representing vasculature. In case of drugs, it is well-known that its metabolic products can sometimes have adverse effects on body systems other than the target [228]. By only studying an isolated organs in vitro, the vital information that can emerges from synergistic effects on the entire organ systems can be lost. Use of body-on-chip can help capture that information, not only with reference to drug interactions, but also for disease etiologies or basic biological processes [229,230]. The use of 3D bioprinting technologies are helping to print complex tissues with diverse types of matrix, cells, growth factors, etc. The tissues in the organ-on-chip and body-on-chip can now be 3D printed at high resolutions and in a highly replicative manner. This has supported advancement of the organ-onchip and body-on-chip systems from investigative stage to use as a reliable diagnostic tool.
Integration of nanotechnology
Nanotechnology is the understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nm, where unique phenomena enable novel applications (https://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101). Based on the application, nanotechnology can involve either measuring, modeling, imaging, or manipulating matter at then nanoscale. In the field of TE, use of nanoparticles has been shown to significantly enhance the physical and biological properties of scaffolds and also serve various functions based on the application [231]. Examples of nanoparticles used in TE include titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), gold nanoparticles (GNPs), CNTs, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), and GO nanoparticles. Titanium oxide nanoparticles have been primarily been used to improve the mechanical properties of TE scaffolds but have also been observed to enhance cell proliferation. Nanocomposite polymers with TiO2 have shown superior mechanical properties compared to plain polymers for TE applications [232,233], including a biodegradable patch that was used to reinforce
scars after myocardial infarction [234]. When 3D-printed scaffolds made from PLGA were used to culture human ES cell derived cardiomyocytes, incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles within the scaffolds resulted in enhanced proliferation of these cells. GNPs are widely used in TE. Electrical properties of scaffolds have been enhanced using GNPs, particularly for cardiac TE [235]. Examples of such studies include better striation and enhancements in electrical coupling of cardiac cells when decellularized matrices incorporating GNPs were used [236]. In other studies, use of electrospun scaffolds containing GNP improved the treatment outcomes of infarcted heart [237]. For bone TE, GNPs have been shown to enhance osteoclast formation from hematopoietic cells [238], promote osteogenic differentiation in cells such as MSCs, and MC3T3-E1 (osteoblast precursor cells) [239]. Since, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) is the primary biological factor that can modulate these biological response, GNPs can be viewed as replacements for BMPs in certain situation and can also be good candidates for inclusion in bone TE applications. Another example where GNPs have substituted the use of growth factors is for direct stemcell differentiation. In a study, scaffolds incorporating gold nanowires and GNPs could direct stem-cell differentiation, without using growth factors [235]. This is another example that shows that certain nanoparticles can be used to substitute use of biological factors, which are known to have various side effects when applied in the body. Nanoparticles could be a new tool for controlling TE outcomes. Infection of a surgical site is a wide spread problem in clinical medicine even after availability of many ways to prevent and treat it. For tissue-engineered constructs, most of which would be surgically implanted at the target site, one way to prevent or treat the possibility of postsurgical infection is to incorporate an antimicrobial agent within the construct itself, mostly within the scaffold. Metal oxides such as iron-oxide nanoparticles, AgNPs, and selenium nanoparticles are widely being used for this purpose. Silver nanoparticles are more popular as antimicrobial agent and have been used in TE of skin [240], bone [241], and vascular grafts [242]. In addition to antimicrobial effects, AgNPs have shown to have wound healing capabilities [243]. Recently, the application of MNPs has been explored as a versatile tool for TE. For this, the MNPs are either direct incorporation into a scaffold matrix or the cells being seeded on the scaffolds are prelabeled with MNPs by internalization [244]. Using an external magnetic field, these MNPs can now be tracked or used for guiding cells, thereby making the resulting tissue magnetically responsive. This is an economical and attractive way to monitor and stimulate cells in vitro. In one study, Gomes et al. have used magnetic scaffolds where magnetic stimulation was used to differentiate human ADSCs for tendon
18 CHAPTER | 1 Tissue engineering: current status and future perspectives


regeneration [244]. On implantation into an ectopic rat model, these scaffolds also showed good biocompatibility and integration within the surrounding tissues. Cezar et al. created biphasic iron-containing scaffolds (ferrogels) for use in muscle TE [245]. On implantation into a mouse muscle injury model and remote magnetic actuation, uniform cyclic compressions were observed in the engineered muscle. Consequently, there was also a reduction in inflammation, reduction in fibrosis, better regeneration, and around three-fold increase in the maximum contractile force of the target muscle. This was a significant outcome because use of a biphasic ferrogel to stimulate and regenerate injured muscle can mean avoiding use of growth factors or cells for muscle regeneration. In another study, Antman-Passig and Shefi [246] used collagen hydrogels with MNPs for neuronal TE. These collagens in the injectable hydrogels could be aligned in vivo by the application of an external magnetic field and the alignment could be actively controlled postimplantation. This magnetically controlled patterning supported elongation and directional growth of primary neurons, which also exhibited normal electrical activity. Another interesting application of MNPs can be seen in magnetic field guided cell targeting. Swaminathan et al. used superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPION) to label smooth muscle cells (derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell) and deliver them to abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) wall [247]. The use of SPIONs also did not have any adverse effects on cells and then authors believe that this could be a new approach for in situ AAA repair. Integration of sensors in biological and tissueengineered systems for real-time monitoring and data acquisition is a latest trend. Millimeter-sized living tissues fabricated in a microphysiological devices format are known as organs-on-a-chip. Integrating sensors in organson-a-chip platforms can allow real-time tracking and monitoring of selected physiological response without interfering with the tissue/ organ function. Examples of such an approach include development of a cardiac tissue patch that integrated an electronic network within the engineered tissue [248]. The network collects information from the tissue microenvironment and can be used for electrical stimulation, synchronizing cell contraction, or drug release on demand. Similarly, Lieber et al. developed a flexible scaffold mimicking 3D nanoelectronic array for engineering a cardiac tissue for a transient arrhythmia disease model [249]. This unique scaffold was used for mapping the action potential propagation in then developing cardiac tissues as well as using controlled electric stimulation to manipulate the tissue electrophysiology. Use of such nanoelectronics containing scaffolds can not only allow for spatiotemporal monitoring and control of developing cardiac tissues, but the data
collected can reveal important parameters for better engineering of cardiac tissues. In a different application, Bavli et al. integrated sensors into liver-on-chip device for monitoring mitochondrial dysfunction in native liver microenvironments [250]. In chemically caused toxicity, mitochondrial damage and dysfunction happens that can often go undetected. This sensor containing liver-on-chip device was able to monitor real-time mitochondrial respiration and stress.
Current challenges
TE as a new field was introduced more than 20 years ago; however, the current technology for engineering complex tissues for clinical use is still far from ideal. Conventional scaffold fabrication methods such as soft lithography, electrospinning, and freeze drying usually generate reduced reproducibility between scaffolds [251] and cell deposition accuracy during the scaffold fabrication is relatively low. Development of better biofabrication technologies such as SLA, 3D bioprinting, and laser bioprinting have resulted in better scaffolds and resulting tissues, but they are still insufficient to recreate the complex structural, cellular, and functional organization of higher order tissues and organs. This will be critical not only for successful clinical translation of TE products but also acceptance of TE as a mainstream field of medicine. Many challenges to the field of TE are specific to a particular technology or process. For example, when using electrospun grafts in clinical applications, the precise and reproducible control over fiber formation, their morphology, and composition is a big challenge. The manufacturing scale-up of the electrospinning process is also a concern because of the relatively slow rate of collection of electrospun fibers. In addition, homogenous cell distributions within such scaffolds are difficult to achieve. New methods that have been developed to address this issue include multilayered electrospinning, use of low fiber packing density, cell electrospraying, and dynamic cell culture in bioreactors. 3D bioprinting is an advanced biofabrication technology that is aiding in generation of complex scaffolds and tissues for RM. Compared to conventional manufacturing methods, 3D bioprinting can be used to generate predesigned scaffolds and cell arrangement that can mimic higher order tissues within the body. Therefore this technology is highly desirable for creating products for tissue/ organ repair and regeneration. In addition, bioprinted tissues would be highly reproducible, which is a requirement for commercial production. The development of suitable bioinks is currently the bottleneck of bioprinting technology. Since the ECM as well as cellular compositions of different tissue are highly diverse, the development of a universal bioink for ubiquitous application
Tissue engineering: current status and future perspectives Chapter | 1 19


proves highly difficult. For successful TE using 3D bioprinting, the bioinks have to be nontoxic, immunecompatible, biodegradable, and the degradation products should be harmless to the host and should ideally support the cells in their desired organization and function. Therefore development of novel, versatile, and tunable bioinks that meet many of the above criteria would be pivotal for the success of bioprinting as a robust tissue fabrication technology. Standardization of 3D bioprinters, the bioprinting process, bioinks, product and process scale-up, testing and quality control etc. are all challenges that will have to be addresses sooner than later. Finding a suitable cell sources and obtaining sufficient quantities of cells has always been a challenge. In addition, for clinical applications, autologous cell source are preferable, which are difficult to get in many cases. Engineering of complex tissues will also require multiple cell types in sufficient qualities, unless stem cells are being used to derive these cell types. Creating suitable bioactive scaffolds where all these different cell types can grow, interact, build their own ECM, and perform in vivo like function is another major challenge in TE. Reducing the immunogenicity of TE scaffold is one of the most critical requirements of the decellularization strategy. This aspect might have been critical in preventing the widespread use of decellularized ECM as scaffolds in clinical applications. This is particularly true for xenogenic scaffolds. If their immunogenicity is not sufficiently reduced, they can be rejected in vivo, leading to functional failure of the engineered scaffold of tissue. Use of detergents such as SDS and Triton X-100 can significantly reduce the presence of protein-based immunogenic components [252], while the use of endonucleases such as DNAse and RNAse has been shown to remove the nucleic acid components significantly. Use of mechanical decellularization approaches such as freeze thaw and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) can leave behind DNA remnants, which are immunogenic. Use of more extensive wash procedures and a combination of different enzymatic methods can completely clear these scaffolds of immunogenic components. Engineering vascular tissues continue to remain a major challenge in TE. Without proper vascularization, the lack of nutrition or buildup of waste will inevitably lead to necrosis or cell death in the engineered tissues and organs [253]. This will invariably restrict their size and complexity, and their regeneration applications. To address this, many attempts are being made to engineering vascular structures. Current strategies include generating a hollow tubular network using sacrificial filaments followed by perfusion of vascular cells into the network [254], use of a modified thermal inkjet printer to printing microvascular networks [255], use of 3D printing to generate a sacrificial filament and then embed the filament network into hydrogel with encapsulated cells [254], or
use 3D bioprint vascularized structure using multiple cell types and ECM substrates [214]. Even when a tissueengineered construct can be made with vascularization support, its integration within the host (anastomosis) is a big challenge. Immune complications can also arise during this process, resulting in rejection of the implant. Although several studies have shown that vascularized small constructs, when transplanted into immunecompromised host mice can successfully integrate with the host blood supply, the implants used were usually small (maximum) 6-mm diameter and 1-mm thick [256]. As the dimensions of the tissue exceeds beyond this number, its vascularization and integration with the host vasculature is increasingly difficult. This is indeed a bottleneck for TE and a challenge that is being addressed. When a technology is considered suitable for clinical use, there still can be major regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome before this translation is realized. These hurdles can be associated with commercialization, clinical trials, or both. Most of the regulations are designed to ensure safety of the patients who will be recipients of these products. Regulatory assessment considers the risk profile of the technology, the materials and processes used in manufacturing, storage, transport to the bedside, etc. Furthermore, the process scale-up and approvals for clinical applications are some of the aspects that can be complex and time consuming. Another important, but often overlooked, challenge for TE is the social acceptance of this technology. Finally, the willingness of patients to accept this technology and its products will determine its success (or failure). Hence, robust ethical discussions will also be required for realistic consideration and promotion of TE for successful clinical applications. For TE, each individual tissue or organ poses its own engineering challenge. This is due to the fact that among other things, spatial constraints, physical forces, biochemical cues, individual cell types, and their growth programs can vary widely between each tissue type. Organs are even more complex in terms of these parameters. For this reason, most of the current tissue/organ models still cannot fully replicate in vivo biology. Being mostly a single tissue/organ model, they largely miss the dynamic effects of an organism’s physiological status. As for the cell sources, ES cells, adult stem cells, and iPSCs require distinct environments to effectively induce their differentiation and tissue formation. Therefore designs of engineered tissues/organs will not only require expertise in bioengineering but also progressing biological knowledge that would drive such biodesigns. Another challenge in the field of TE is the lack of knowledge about the degree of self-assembly and remodeling that the engineered tissue will undergo after fabrication or in vivo implantation. This is an area that will need further research and knowledge generation, not only for the

engineering aspect, but also from the clinical and regulatory point of view. While use of nanoparticles in TE has shown many benefits, such as enhancement of mechanical, biological, and electrical properties, and aid in gene delivery, antimicrobial effects, and molecular imaging, many challenges still lie ahead for using them in widespread clinical applications. Concerns that need to be addressed related to use of nanoparticles include nanoparticle toxicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and their bioaccumulation inside the body over a long period of time. A compelling need exists for developing better tools and methods to assess nanoparticle toxicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity because most nanoparticles used in the human body have the potential to accumulate over a long period of time. This will allow them to reach a concentration that can cause toxicity to cells, resulting in cancers or harmful effects on physiological systems such as brain and reproductive systems and possibly also on the fetuses before their birth. During the past 10 years, the basic and applied science base of TE has made great progressed in many areas. However, the clinical and commercial successes that were initially predicted have been slow to come. The slow clinical and commercial progress of TE can be attributed more to issues other than the science and technology. Scale-up issues in biomanufacturing, few than expected clinical trials, regulatory processes and health economics are some of the reasons for this. However, many of these hurdles are being overcome and the progress is encouraging. The coming decade is expected to more advancements, including incorporation of more new technologies, evolution of smart biomaterials, widespread use of stem cells, fabrication of more complex tissues and whole organs, use of bioengineered tissue as replacement for animal testing, personalized medicine, and clinical translation of way more tissue-engineered products. Development of complex tissues and organs involves the intricate process of coordinated cell growth, differentiation, morphogenesis, and maturation of diverse populations of cells. Although the ability to engineer complex tissues and whole organs is attractive and has the potential to impact translational medicine, it is still a major challenge. To meet this challenge, knowledge from multiple disciplines such as development, anatomy, physiology, and cell biology will have to be combined with enabling technologies such as biomaterials, biofabrication (including 3D bioprinting), advanced bioreactors, 3D modeling, high-content imaging, and nanotechnology.
Future directions
Through a greater understanding of biology, technological advancement, multidisciplinary approach, and clinical
studies, the fields of TE and RM have been steadily advancing. Since TE is both a multi- and interdisciplinary science, joint efforts of different specialties will be needed for the commercial and clinical success of TE products. At least for commercial applications, TE and RM should be viewed from a systems engineering perspective. Successful translation of more TE technologies will be needed for long-term success of this field and also to establish confidence in TE and RM as viable solutions to many unmet medical needs. The clinical feasibility of TE and RM products has already been demonstrated for several applications. Now the challenge is for showing their efficacy in real-world patients. To benefit a larger patient population, manufacturing of these products will have to be scaled-up, produced reproducibly with high-quality control, and made broadly available in an economical way. From a business perspective, the challenges for TE and RM will be more than just the technology. A viable business model will have to be developed that takes into consideration the technology, regulatory aspects, cost considerations, and the healthcare landscape. From the science and technology perspective, some of the most promising aspects that will drive the field of TE in the future are discussed next:
Smart biomaterials
A better understanding of the interactions of biomaterials with cells and tissue in vivo will help develop the nextgeneration of biocompatible materials for TE and RM applications. For example, using computational models of material surface chemistries and studying their interactions with cells can be very helpful. Clinical translation of life science-based technologies is always challenging. Same is the case with TE technologies, particularly smart biomaterials. However, considering some critical factors during the research and development phase can help ensure a better translation to clinical studies and finally to the patients. These include biocompatibility of these materials over longer time (months or years), material performance consistency, and standardization of manufacturing parameters (process scalability, batch to batch reproducibility etc.). The use of computational and machine learning technologies can also have positive benefits for design of biomaterials and improve predictions during manufacturing and their performance in vivo. It is now known that many ECM components have natural immunomodulatory domains that bind to receptors found on immune cells, enabling their adhesion and regulating their function [257]. This is facilitated by bioactive amino acid sequences that encode specific cellular cues. Therefore it is possible to use ECM proteins and/or ECMmodeled peptides in biomaterial scaffolds to mimic the natural regulatory role of the ECM on the host immune

system. This strategy to modulate favorable immune response to can ensure functionality and longevity of TE implants. Proteins-based smart biomaterials (including composite hydrogels) can have unique applications in TE and RM and need further exploration. It is also possible to make composite hydrogels with proteins and synthetic polymers. Burdick et al. have developed a self-assembly mechanism to make such hydrogels [258,259]. These hydrogels can also be further strengthened by reinforcing with photo-reactive groups (such as methacrylate groups), so that the hydrogel crosslinking can be carried out by UV radiation [259]. Biomaterials that can respond to electrical and stimulus are also interesting for many applications. It is well known that electrical stimulation positively affects cardiac cells in culture [260] and other electrically sensitive cells such as neurons have displayed improved growth and function when cultured on conductive scaffolds [261]. Electrically conductive polymers have also been combined with proteins [262] and represent an interesting class of biomaterials that need further exploration. Since some proteins can undergo structural changes in response to mechanical environmental triggers [263], combining such proteins with other biomaterials can result in mechanically responsive smart biomaterials. Growing electrically or mechanically responsive tissues for in vitro use or for in vivo for tissue regeneration would represent another advancement in the field of TE.
Cell sources
Stem cells may have their own drawback and pose certain common challenges that must be overcome to achieve clinical utility of TE. Full commitment to each germ layer in culture will be an important achievement in the development of tissue-engineered products containing stem cells. This can be achieved by optimizing growth factor combinations and use of advanced bioreactors, such as the one exemplified by scaled-up production of definitive endoderm in recent years [264]. Recent efforts to derive a wide variety of specialized cells from human ES and iPS cells are becoming successful. Examples include cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, hepatocytes, insulinproducing beta-like cells, neuronal and other cells of the nervous system, including oligodendrocytes and subsets of astrocytes.
Embryonic stem cells
More efforts are needed for ensuring success of pluripotent stem cells (such as ES cells) as a source for cell therapy and tissue-engineered products. Purity of differentiated cell populations and exclusion of potentially tumorigenic undifferentiated stem cells must be confirmed
for every application. In addition, the maturity of differentiated cells is still an issue, where some of the differentiated cells can retain embryonic phenotypes. For examples, detailed studies of various differentiated cell lineages (such as hepatocytes and pancreatic β cells) have highlighted the difficulty of achieving fully adult phenotypes from ES cells [265]. The completion of development may actually require additional maturation for several months in vivo, as shown for endocrine pancreatic progenitors of insulin-producing β-like cells. Therefore while serving as useful models for human development, the immature cells derived from pluripotent stem cells may have significant limitations as components of safe and effective tissue-engineered therapies. In the future, a selection of small molecules could replace growth factors and hormones in driving key steps in the differentiation sequence and should facilitate development of cost-effective therapeutic products [266]. The production of ES cells and differentiation to pancreatic progenitors have been recently scaled-up under conditions compatible with GMP to support clinical testing [266]. It is anticipated that the grafted cells will be susceptible to acute immune attack, both by alloreactive T cells and by the autoimmune T cells that initially caused the patients’ type 1 diabetes. One strategy to avoid this would be to deliver a tissue-engineered product with the therapeutic cells encapsulated in a semipermeable device designed to protect them from the immune system, while allowing exchange of nutrients and release of insulin to the circulation. The need to protect grafts from the recipient’s immune system is a fundamental problem for cell therapy and TE [267]. Due to the genetic mismatch between donors and recipients, the risk of immune rejection must be considered for any cell therapy or tissue-engineered products based on ES cells. One potential way to ensure successful allotransplantation of these cells would be to modify ES cells genetically to knock out MHC Class I, and possibly Class II, expression [267]. This might be the reason why differentiated ES cell derivatives show lower immunogenicity than do corresponding adult human cells [268]. There are some methods that can be used to induce immunological tolerance in recipients of allogeneic stem-cellderived grafts [269,270]. One such method is nonablative treatment of the host with monoclonal antibodies to the T-cell antigens CD4 and CD8 [271] successful; this approach would not only allow for off-the-shelf also tissue therapies but also lower the safety and economic barriers to widespread adoption of ES cell-based therapies in medical practice. Another approach in this direction rests on cell banking strategies. The simple process of deriving clinically relevant ES cells from blood group O donors eliminates the issues of ABO type compatibility [267]. In addition, establishment of GMP-grade ES cell line banks
22 CHAPTER | 1 Tissue engineering: current status and future perspectives


of relatively modest size (say 50 200 lines from appropriately selected donors) would enable complete and efficient matching at the most important MHC loci (HLA-A, -B, and -DR) for the large majority of the population. The derivation of ES cells from parthenogenetic embryos (that are homozygous for HLA loci) or selection of rare HLAhomozygous donors from the general population for obtaining pluripotent stem-cell lines can also significantly decrease the size of bank required to ensure matching of most potential recipients [272]. Stem-cell line banking on a global scale seems an idealistic but potentially feasible goal for future development of cell and tissue-engineered therapies [273].
Induced pluripotent stem cells
iPSCs are strong candidate cells for the future of TE. Already the next generation of reprograming methods are evolving where drug-like compounds can substitute for some of the transcription factors [274,275]. Indeed, recent studies have shown that efficient generation of iPSCs can be achieved using a single transcription factor OCT4 and a cocktail of small molecules [276]. Another recent method utilizes a microRNA (miR-302) that regulates chromatin demethylation and other factors involved in global reprograming [277]. For future clinical application, it will be necessary that reprograming to generate iPSCs be carried out under GMP-compliant conditions. This has been accomplished to some extent [278]. Scale-up to yield clinical grade cell therapy and tissue-engineered constructs from iPSCs also raises the same essential manufacturing and regulatory concerns that have been discussed for the ES cells. In spite of all the progress, questions still remain about whether iPSCs are completely equivalent to ES cells in their genetic makeup and in their potential to yield a full range of differentiated cell types. Critical issues that must be addressed for future therapeutic applications would center on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the resetting of pluripotency [279,280]. Also to be addressed would be genetic and epigenetic variations that might persist through the reprograming process into the mature, specialized cells that will be used for therapy [281]. On the manufacturing side, it is possible that best practices from other cell therapy development will be applied to iPSCs and standards will be established to meet high level of uniformity and quality needed for such therapies. On the regulatory side, assurance of long-term performance and safety will be necessary, similar to what is required for any cell and tissue-engineered therapies. Another future direction for iPSCs would be to use blood cells, such as the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as preferred starting material for the production of clinical grade iPS cell lines [282]. The epigenetic and
gene expression signatures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been shown to more closely resemble those of pluripotent stem cells, than for the fibroblasts. As for the cellular reprograming factors, the addition of Zscan4 (a zinc finger protein that is expressed selectively in 2-cell embryos) to the “Yamanaka” set of transcription factors decreased the DNA damage response during reprograming of mouse somatic cells and improved the yield of pluripotent cells [283]. This will be an interesting direction to explore for future use of iPSCs.
Adult stem cells
A relatively new cell source canned amniotic fluidderived stem (AFS) cells that possibly represent a primitive precursors of MSC, have recently gaining a lot of attention. AFS cells are isolated from amniotic fluid or chorionic villi and share some properties with adult MSC but are capable of more extensive proliferation in cultures [284]. Since they also express some markers in common with ES cells, their precise lineage and physiological plasticity are still not certain. However, such as MSCs, AFS cells also possess immunomodulatory properties that could benefit their clinical utility [285]. A clear advantage over MSCs is their abundance (in amniotic fluid) and ease of isolation. For the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions and for neural TE, the brain-derived neural stem cells (such as HuCNS-SC) look promising. Future clinical trials based on HpSC may use cells sourced from neonatal livers that can be obtained through organ donation. Hepatic stem and progenitor cells are known to survive relatively long under ischemic conditions as compared to other stem cells [286]. Plus the development of cryopreservation and large-scale culture conditions for these cells will further make them popular for cell and tissue-engineered therapies in the future. For liver TE, using HpSC in combination with endothelial progenitors such as the liver-derived angioblasts on whole-organ decellularized scaffolds can be a practical strategy [95,287]. Also delivering HpSC in a liverspecific matrix components (hydrogel) along with growth factors might help promote a more rapid, robust differentiation to hepatocytes [95]. In vivo studies in mice have confirmed that human biliary tree stem cells are multipotent for liver and pancreas lineages [288]. More studies will be needed with higher animal models and humans before these cells are declared useful for clinical applications. The biliary tree stem cells can easily be harvested from tissue that is frequently discarded after certain surgical procedures. Their easy availability and isolation (even through a simple procedure such as laparoscopy) represents a great value as a potential cell source for TE of islet-like structures for treating insulin-dependent diabetes.

Whole organ engineering
Use of decellularized organs is a practical approach of bioengineering whole organs for possible clinical use in transplantation. Studies of decellularized tissues and organs are advancing in scope, and some are already used in clinical studies. Since the ECM is much more than just a scaffold for cells and can also control cell organization, communication, and tissue functions, properties of the decellularized tissues can be a primary determinant and dictate reconstruction outcomes. New approaches in this area are focusing on developing decellularized tissues and organs with added benefits, such as retention of intact vasculatures, functionalization via biomaterials, and bioactive factors. When using decellularized tissues and organs for bioengineering new ones for transplantation, a complete assessment of decellularization is important. To prevent immune rejection, native antigens must be removed from the decellularized scaffolds. Also, of particular concern is the hyperacute immune rejection of a decellularized scaffold, which can occur anytime during the days or weeks after implantation [289]. This is caused by circulating antibodies to scaffold antigens within the host. Examples of decellularized scaffold that can trigger a hyperacute immune response include alpha-gal epitopes [289], structural proteins such as collagen VI of the ECM [290]. Even though structural proteins such as collagen VI are necessary for the mechanical stability of the scaffold, it is possible to limit their immunogenic effect. This will be necessary to prevent rejection after implantation into a host. Every decellularization strategy can produce different effects on structural proteins within a scaffold. Therefore suitable method(s) must be chosen taking into consideration the target tissue type, tissue biomechanics, recellularization method, etc. Some commonly used chemical and mechanical decellularization methods have been known to damage ECM proteins [291]. Since it may be difficult to have a universal decellularization method for all tissue types, reagents and methods can be optimized based on tissue type, size, recellularization method being used, etc. The recellularization of the decellularized scaffold must also be optimized to produce a functional tissue or organ. The recellularization process has its own challenges. Primary among them is even distributions of the cells throughout the scaffold. Perfusion of cells through the vasculature of the construct is a common method used. Other methods include directly injecting cells into the tissue, using sonication to facilitate cell seeding and reendothelializing the vasculature of decellularized scaffold to improve seeding and organization of the cells [292]. Use of bioreactors has vastly improved the seeding and support of cells within decellularized scaffold for TE. For example, use of rotating wall vessel bioreactor has been shown to facilitated greater cell proliferation and viability [217].
Although great advancements have been made in whole organ bioengineering using decellularization, further efforts are needed to optimize reagents, methods, and equipment to achieve reproducible results. Use of a combined strategy that includes chemicals, mechanicals, and enzymes in a dynamic system may improve the decellularization efficiency and still retain components that will support efficient recellularization. For example, cells can be lysed using supercritical CO2, followed by treatment with a low concentration of surfactants. Remaining cellular and genetic materials can be removed using wash with an enzymatic mixture, followed by buffers to remove all debris. Another area that needs further improvement is the scale-up of these decellularization and recellularization methods, so that enough scaffolds are available for making neo-tissues and organs to bridge the gap between donors and needy patients. Cell sourcing is also a bottleneck for whole organ bioengineering. With exploration of more adult stem-cell sources and human iPSCs, it would be possible to manufacture off-the-shelf tissues and organs in the future. This will help reduce or possibly eliminate the ever-increasing wait list and time for transplants.
Biofabrication technologies
Many TE applications have benefitted from the use of electrospun scaffolds. The high tunability of this technology can help both mechanical and bioactivity properties of the scaffolds. Recent advances in elecrospinning methods are further advancing these potentials by creating additional tools to guide cellular response and achieve enhanced tissue regeneration by generating aligned fibers, enhanced porosity, gradients of functional moieties, etc. New electrospinning methods such as coaxial electrospinning, fiber blending, emulsion electrospinning, and edge electrospinning can enable combining of different materials properties into a single scaffold. Other new methods such as coelectrospinning, hydrospinning, and 3D electrospinning are being used for generating complex fibers and scaffold architectures, and more developments are expected in the future. Enhancing cellular infiltration within electrospun scaffolds has always been a challenge. However, new electrospinning methods such as coelectrospinning, postelectrospinning processing and coaxial electrospinning have made it possible to ensure better and more uniform distribution of cells within electrospun scaffolds. Moving forwards, there are some common challenges to be addressed before electrospun scaffolds and tissues generated using them become mainstream in clinical applications. First, fiber formation, morphology, and composition have to be controlled, so that they are precise and reproducible in a manufacturing setting. Scaffolds with clinically relevant dimensions need to be made with sufficient process control of the electrospinning scale-up.
24 CHAPTER | 1 Tissue engineering: current status and future perspectives


Cellular infiltration can be enhanced by further refining techniques such as multilayered electrospinning, cell layering, cell electrospraying, and dynamic cell culture systems. Despite these challenges, electrospinning remains a versatile technology and when combined with ever increasing innovative approaches, it is sure to have a lasting impact in the field of TE Advances in 3D bioprinting hardware and the bioprinting processes are making it possible to fabricate tissues with different levels of complexities. However, this can present additional challenges when these technologies move from lab to commercialization. Accuracy and repeatability are two basic standards of quality that should be taken into consideration during manufacturing. Limiting the intrinsic variability during production can help reduce the extrinsic variability of such complex engineered tissue and organs when placed in in vivo environments [293]. Interestingly, 3D bioprinting, just like other additive manufacturing processes, can allow for inprocess inspection of the product being produced, which is a positive attribute for quality control. To increase the printing speed of multimaterial and multicell constructs, new 3D printing devices and strategies are being proposed. Also, development of perfusable vascular networks within biofabricated structures is also gaining importance from a clinical perspective. 3D cell culture techniques are also a recent trend and have contributed to significant progress in development of tissuespecific organoids, which is one of the scientific breakthroughs of recent years. Taken together, advances in 3D bioprinting, new bioink hydrogels, and 3D cell culturing are providing new opportunities for successful translation of tissue regeneration technologies and also gaining a better understanding of mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis and progression. A future area of development in TE being made possible due to nanotechnology is referred to as “4D bioprinting.” Here “time” is included as a fourth dimension in 3D bioprinting constructs, which can change their shapes or functionalities with time in response to external stimuli [118]. All these examples demonstrate the value of using nanotechnology in RM, which can add unique functionalities and broaden the portfolio of tools available for TE. Looking ahead, 3D bioprinting will benefit from advances in CAD/computeraided manufacturing, standardization of materials, cells, and procedures to 1 day offer patient-specific tissue and organ repair therapies. There is no doubt that 3D bioprinting is transforming from an emerging trend to a main stream biomedical technology.
Tissue neovasculatization
3D bioprinting of vascular networks represents the best approach for creating vascular networks in engineered
tissue and organs. Future efforts in this direction should also include design considerations, such as ability to withstand burst pressure and suitability for direct surgical anastomosis to host vasculature. The fabrication process can become even more complex when vasculature becomes part of the design. However, in vivo success of thick tissues and organs cannot be guaranteed without this.
Bioreactors
The type and complexity of the tissue being cultured in the bioreactor will affect the process design. Viscosity of the medium can also impose a mechanical load and affect cell morphology through cellular signaling [294]. It’s been also observed that stem cells, when subjected to mechanical stimuli, can undergo what is known as mechano-differentiation [295,296]. All these topics are focus of intense research, which are going to influence future bioreactor designs. It is clear that to mimic in vivo organ function, there is considerable complexity required in bioreactor design. Use of computational modeling (also referred to as in silico analysis) using parameters from normal tissue/organ physiology and incorporating it into bioreactor construction can definitely improve TE outcomes. An example of this approach is a study where necessary parameters for vascular TE were derived by using a computer model to analyze fluid-structure interaction [297]. Results from this modeling matched results from an analytical model where predictions were made for pressures on the tubular scaffolds, wall shear stress, and circumferential deformation. Hence, use of in silico analysis can provide critical information that can enhance the development of the right bioreactor and culture conditions for complex tissues and organs.
Integration of nanotechnology
Current methods of cell patterning includes creation of physical patterns (using techniques such as ablation, etching, lithography, and printing), chemically modifying surface, or producing substrates with inherent topographies (fibers, hydrogels, etc.). All these methods have limitations of their own. Use of MNPs for cell control and patterning provides a new tool for fabricating tissue architecture that can match in vivo conditions. Examples of this approach include a study where a heterotypic coculture of mouse myoblast and human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells was generated and capillary-like structures were formed with HUVEC cells [298]. Thus using nanoparticles, the biological properties of scaffolds and the resulting constructs can be significantly altered; thereby helping to engineering tissues with better overall function. Further integration and use of sensors and other electronic

elements in TE systems can support long-term studies and provide insights into the function, pathophysiological conditions, and also response to treatments. In a clinical setting, such system can monitor implanted tissues and organs in patients and provide important information on time if an intervention, drug adjustment, or other type of care is needed for the success of the implant. When translating nano-specific technologies to clinical applications, there are many challenges to overcome. For example, in applications where the chronic bioaccumulation of nanoparticles is a possibility, more long-term studies will be needed to determine safety. In products the notification of chemicals, criteria for classification, and labeling requirements are not widely available and will have to be revised. In addition to the technology itself, regulatory aspects will have to be addressed. Currently, there are no specific standards for nano-specific risk assessments within biological systems, nor clear regulatory guidelines for biological products containing nanoparticles. All these are challenges that need to be addressed for integration of nanotechnology in tissue-engineered clinical products.
Conclusions and future challenges
With advances in TE, technological advances such as use of stem cell, gene editing, 3D bioprinting, and nanotechnology, are enabling fabrication of tissue/organ with increasing complexities, resolution, and functionality, thereby supporting regenerative therapies that are tailored to specific patients and their needs. Use of electronic components or magnetic responsive elements within TE products can enable such features, where sensing and actuation can be controlled remotely and host response can be actively modulated postimplantation of the TE product. This has a potential to revolutionize not only patient follow-up but also regenerative therapies for human patients. Based on the requirements of individual patients, drug dosages, cells delivery, or treatment outcomes can be controlled which can significantly broaden the therapeutic efficacy of current TE systems. In addition, use of use of real-time monitoring and control systems in TE can advance our knowledge of disease mechanisms and homeostasis. One more area that can immensely help personalization of TE is use of artificial intelligence (AI) and large-scale data analysis. AI and data analytics can significantly accelerate design, fabrication, and testing of TE systems in future based on feedbacks from current products and processes. In all, use of personalized TE therapies can not only benefit patient outcomes but can also result in huge savings of social and healthcare costs, as inefficient and failed therapies are associated with huge costs at the healthcare and personal levels.
One of the future challenges in TE will be to develop technologies for faster biofabrication of complex, hierarchical tissue architectures, and human-scale dimensions for accurately recapitulating living tissues and organs. For successful TE, a smart biomaterial should not only mimic the structural components of the ECM but also be able to interact with cells in a dynamic way to promote adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue morphogenesis. However, the design of smart materials combines several of these properties is still a challenge. For example, it can be challenging to develop a smart material with optimal chemical and mechanical properties without negatively affecting its biological properties or vice versa. Of course, understanding the fundamental biology of tissue formation, growth, and maturation will be critical for developing bio-inspired materials, but deriving ideally fabricated structures out of them can further be challenging. This is due to the fact that TE by itself is a multistep, multicomponent approach, and finding the perfect solution at every step can be more difficult than easy. Many novel synthetic and smart biomaterials have been developed in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. For biomaterials to be used for fabricating medical devices and tissue-engineered constructs, the development of efficient and safe sterilization, packaging, and storage methods, with minimal impact on the properties and performance of the material components will be necessary. Unfortunately, not much efforts are being places in this direction, which has to change if commercialization and clinical use of tissue-engineered products will have to be accelerated. Significant challenges for translation of biomaterial technology to the clinic still remain. A major limitation toward designing biomaterials for different TE applications is the limited fundamental understanding of the interactions between material and cells within tissues. Even though biomaterial engineering is producing materials with the ability to control cellular behavior to some extent, many challenges still remain in creating smart biomaterials that can respond to cells and their environments after implantation in vivo. Another challenge for the future would be the real-time monitoring and/or remote manipulation of tissueengineered systems. Success in this direction will help establish a new paradigm for RM broadly.

Introduction
Tissue engineering aims to understand the principles of in vivo tissue growth and development and applies this understanding to the engineering of functional replacement tissue ex vivo for clinical use subsequent to disease or injury. However, tissue formation is an inherently complex process—involving multiple biological, chemical, and physical processes that interact on a variety of length scales and timescales—and deciphering general principles of tissue development is a challenging task [1]. Nevertheless, a deep understanding of these principles is necessary to efficiently engineer functional tissue in vitro. For this reason, tissue engineering approaches commonly coordinate techniques from a variety of different disciplines, including molecular, cell and developmental biology, chemical engineering, and biophysics, to dissect this complexity. Recent years have seen an increasing interest in applying tools from the mathematical and computational sciences to the design, development, and implementation of tissue engineering protocols [2,3]. Mathematical and computational models are routinely used to help understand complex systems and optimize industrial processes in the engineering and physical sciences. There are many remarkable examples of the long-standing use of quantitative methods in the cell and molecular biosciences [4]. Recent rapid advances in both available computational power and high-throughput experimental procedures have stimulated an extraordinary cross-fertilization of ideas from the mathematical, statistical, physical, and life sciences, particularly within the areas of systems biology and bioinformatics [5]. Concurrently, much progress has also been made in recent years toward
understanding general principles of tissue growth and development. In this chapter, we will explore how mathematical models, in collaboration with experimental studies and machine learning, can help further understanding of these principles. Given the breadth and rapid growth of this field, we will necessarily only focus on a few key areas, particularly: understanding molecular basis of stem and progenitor cell fate commitment; spatiotemporal regulation of cellular differentiation; and general principles of tissue morphogenesis.
Modeling stem cell dynamics
Stem cells are present during all stages of the development and are uniquely characterized by their capacity to maintain their numbers by self-renewing, as well as differentiate along distinct lineages. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have the capacity to produce all somatic tissues, a property known as pluripotency, and there is much interest in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of pluripotency [6]. Following the seminal work of the Yamanaka group in demonstrating that adult fibroblasts could be reprogramed to ES cell-like state by the forced expression of just four pluripotency-associated transcription factors (Klf4, c-Myc, Oct-3/4, and Sox2), there is a hope of using adult somatic cell derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells as patient specific, and less controversial, alternatives to human ES cells [7 9]. In contrast to ES and iPS cells, adult stem cells are typically lineage restricted and thereby constrained in their therapeutic potential (they are generally only multior unipotent) [10]. Nevertheless, due to their regenerative

capacities and the relative ease, with which they may be obtained, there is also considerable interest in understanding the processes, by which adult stem cells orchestrate tissue growth and development and applying this understanding to engineering functional replacement tissue in the laboratory [1]. A standard tissue engineering approach to this problem is to harvest appropriate stem cell populations and, using defined culture conditions (which include regulating the chemical, physical/mechanical, and geometric properties of the growth environment), recapitulate in vivo regenerative processes to produce functional tissue in vitro. The ultimate success of this strategy relies on a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and the spatiotemporal control of these processes. Stem cell fate is critically dependent upon interactions with neighboring cells—including differentiated progeny [11] and other stem/progenitor cells [12]—and extracellular components that constitute the stem cell niche [13]. Stem cell interactions with the niche are mediated through intracellular molecular regulatory networks that include transcriptional, signaling, and epigenetic regulatory components [14]. These networks are highly complex, containing multiple feedback loops and feed forward loops that allow the cell to respond dynamically to changes in its environment. These types of feedback-based mechanisms are reminiscent of control systems in engineering, and recent years have seen considerable interest in viewing cell fate decisions from a dynamical systems perspective [14]. In the field of synthetic biology field, for instance, switches and oscillators have been implemented experimentally in synthetic model systems using rational designs based upon mathematical reasoning [15 17]. A general principle that emerges from this viewpoint is that the molecular switches that underpin stem cell fate decisions are ultimately dependent upon positive feedback loops in the cells’ underlying intracellular molecular regulatory circuitry [18].
Positive feedback based molecular switches
Positive feedback based switches play a central role during the development by initiating all-or-none commitment events in response to external stimuli and commonly underpin stem and progenitor cell fate decisions, including during hematopoiesis [19]; neural development [20]; and human embryonic and mesenchymal and stem cell fate commitment [21,22]. In order to illustrate the general principle of a feedback-based switch, consider as an example the following dimensionless equations, which describe a simple “toggle switch” consisting two crossinhibitory transcription factors, X and Y [15]:
dx
dt 5 α1
1 1 yβ1 2 x (2.1)
dy
dt 5 α2
1 1 xβ2 2 y (2.2)
where x and y denote the intracellular concentration of X and Y. Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) describe the rate of change in expression of X and Y over time and state that X and Y are synthesized with effective rates α1 and α2, respectively (first terms on the RHS) and decay with constant halflives (second terms on RHS). The parameters β1 and β2 capture cooperativity in repression, allowing for repression by multiprotein complexes and/or binding of multiple regulatory sites on the respective promoters, for instance. Note that although this system is characterized by repressive interactions, it nevertheless represents a simple positive feedback loop since both factors indirectly activate their own expression via inhibiting expression of the other. This kind of switch has been engineered in both Escherichia coli [15] and mammalian cells [23] and behaves as a genetic “memory unit” [15] (indeed it behaves similarly to an SR flip-flop for memory storage in electronic systems). The dynamics of this system may be explored by plotting changes in expression of X and Y against each other to form the system’s phase plane. The phase plane for this system is shown in Fig. 2.1A C for different parameter values. For appropriate regimes, this system supports stable expression of either X or Y, but not coexpression of both, as one might expect (Fig. 2.1A and C). For instance, if the effective rate of synthesis of Y is higher than that of X, then Y is expressed, while X is repressed (Fig. 2.1A); by contrast, if the effective rate of synthesis of X is higher than that of Y, then X is expressed, while Y is repressed (Fig. 2.1C). In these cases, since only one stable equilibrium point is present, the system is said to be monostable. In general, monostability occurs in the absence of cooperativity (β15β2 5 1) or if the effective rates of synthesis of the two repressors are unbalanced (α1cα2 or α1{α2). However, if the effective rates of synthesis of the two repressors are balanced (α1 α2) and transcriptional repression is cooperative (β1; β2 . 1), then these two alternate states may stably coexist (Fig. 2.1B). In this case the system is said to be bistable and it is the capacity of this system to possess different equilibrium patterns of expression depending on parameter values that allow it to act as a switch. Particularly, this system is a toggle switch, since expression of either of the repressors may be toggled “on” and “off” by transiently inducing changes in expression by varying the effective rates of synthesis α1 and α2 [15]. Ultimately, the toggle switch described earlier works, since each factor directly represses transcription of the other while indirectly activating its own transcription.

However, mutual cross-repression is by no means the only positive feedback motif that can give rise to molecular switches of this kind. For instance, direct autoregulation, which is also common in eukaryotic genetic regulatory networks [16,24], can give rise to multistability and switching, either on its own [16] or in concert with other mechanisms. For example, if in addition to mutual cross-repression, each of the transcription factors in the toggle switch also directly regulates its own expression positively then a third “primed” state, in which both factors are promiscuously coexpressed within individual cells, may also be supported resulting in a potentially tristable system. This occurs, for instance, during hematopoiesis: the lineage-specifying master transcription factors, GATA1 and PU.1, each enhance their own expression while repressing that of the other [25]. Since both GATA1
and PU.1 also regulate multiple downstream targets (GATA1 specifies the erythroid/megakaryocyte lineages, while PU.1 specifies the myelomonocytic lineage), the state of this motif affects widespread genetic programs and effectively defines a lineage choice. By differentially regulating multiple downstream targets, positive feedback based switches, such as this, can act as input/output (I/O) devices within larger genetic regulatory networks [26]. In the context of development, positive feedback based I/O devices are important, since they provide a mechanism by which the cell populations can convert spatial information (for instance, an extracellular morphogen gradient) into a defined commitment responses, resulting in spatial localization of widespread gene or protein expression patterns [16,27]. We will discuss further how spatial localization of intracellular feedback mechanisms

Variability in stem cell populations
Although useful, the toggle-switch model given in Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) is deterministic, and it does not account for environmental fluctuations or variability in gene expression, which are inevitably present. Gene and protein expression are intrinsically stochastic processes [28,29] and cell cell variability may arise in isogenic cell populations either due to gene expression “noise,” or due to stochastic partitioning errors or asymmetry during cell division [30 32] (Fig. 2.2). For instance, if such expression noise is accounted for in the toggle-switch model, then cell cell variability in expression patterns can naturally arise within a population of genetically identical cells (Fig. 2.1D F). This variability is particularly evident in the bistable regime, when expression fluctuations can induce transitions between the coexisting stable states (Fig. 2.1E). This kind of cell division independent, nongenetic population heterogeneity is remarkably robust and appears to be a relatively widespread feature of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell populations [33 35]. It has long been postulated that stochasticity may have an important role in stem cell fate commitment [36 39]. In the 1960s Till et al. assessed the colony-forming ability of adult mouse bone marrow cells in the spleens of irradiated mice [36]. Using a serial transplantation assay, they found that the number of colony-forming units (CFUs)
per colony varied considerably beyond that expected from sampling errors alone, in a manner consistent with a “birth-and-death” process (a simple Markov process, well studied in the statistical physics literature [40]), in which CFU self-renewal and differentiation occur stochastically with defined probabilities [36]. They confirmed this conclusion by numerically simulating colony formation using the birth-and-death model, providing a good early example of the use of computational simulations in stem cell biology. Similarly, Ogawa et al. came to related conclusions concerning the stochastic nature of stem cell fate commitment, in their studies of paired hematopoietic progenitor cells in the 1980s [37 39]. Within the last few years, studies have confirmed substantial variability in both equilibrium expression patterns in a variety of mammalian stem and progenitor cell populations [33,41 45] and the dynamics of cellular differentiation and reprograming [21,46,47]. In our own recent work, we have investigated variability in colony-forming ability of primary human bone marrow stromal cell (HBMSC) populations using a two-stage colony-forming assay [48]. We found considerable variability in both the sizes of primary (P0) colonies, seeded from single HBMSCs, and secondary (P1) colonies, formed by detaching cells from P0 colonies and reseeding at clonal density, with apparently little correlation between primary and secondary colony sizes (dependent on the primary colony, transplanted cells produced either small secondary colonies or a wide range of disparate colony sizes). We also observed distinct spatial heterogeneities in expression of mesenchymal and niche-associated markers (including CD146, alpha smooth muscle actin, and alkaline phosphatase, see Fig. 2.3A C) indicating spatial regulation of cell behavior within the colonies. Computational analysis, using a cellular automaton model that accounted for proliferation and migration of individual cells, showed that this behavior is consistent with tissue growth within a structured cellular hierarchy (consisting stem, transit amplifying, and differentiated cell types, see Fig. 2.2), regulated by cell cell interactions. Taken together these results indicate that cell cell variability in expression patterns and stochasticity in stem cell commitment may be closely related, with stochastic mechanisms allowing dynamic “priming” of subpopulations of stem cells for different lineages prior to commitment [49]. These observations suggest that cell fate commitment events are regulated at the population, rather than individual cell, level. Thus intracellular molecular regulatory networks may not control individual stem cell fate commitment per se, but rather control the overall structure of the cellular population [36], possibly by modulating molecular noise [50]. In this regard a more probabilistic view of stem cell fate may be appropriate, in which statistical properties of ensembles of cells,

Stem cells maintain their numbers by symmetric and asymmetric divisions and give rise to transit amplifying progenitor cells, which in turn produce terminally differentiated progeny. This hierarchy of divisions naturally produces a mixed population containing stem, progenitor, and terminally differentiated cell types in proportions that vary with environment, age, and disease or insult.

rather than characteristics of individual cells (or averaged properties of populations of cells) are considered. An enhanced quantitative understanding of the intrinsic variability of stem cell populations will require developments in both high-throughput single-cell profiling procedures and the mathematical and statistical techniques needed to decipher the complex datasets that result from these experimental advances. Such advances will enable a better understanding of how variability can be controlled to produce more defined stem cell populations, which will ultimately lead to the development of more robust stem cell isolation and expansion protocols for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.
Modeling tissue growth and development
Any success in engineering functional tissue ex vivo must rely not only on deciphering individual stem cell behavior but also on developing an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms of morphogenesis in vivo, including the environmental, chemical, mechanical, genetic, and epigenetic processes, involved in spatial regulation of
cellular differentiation. There have been a number of remarkable recent successes in engineering complex, spatially structured, and functional three-dimensional (3D) tissues in the lab, including the optic cup [51]; the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) [52]; the trachea [53]; articular cartilage [54,55]; vascularized bone [56]; and, recently, allogeneic veins [57]. The formation of structure either during in vivo development or ex vivo tissue formation is dependent upon cells translating spatial information concerning their relative location within the developing organism or tissue into different patterns of gene and protein expression based upon their current genetic state and developmental history [58]. The extraordinary reproducibility of development requires not only that positional information is precisely and robustly defined (i.e., insensitive to environmental fluctuations) but also that cellular sensing of such information is correspondingly sensitive and appropriately coordinated. Spatial gradients have long been known to provide positional information for spatial patterning during development (for instance, see the work of Wolpert and coworkers [59 61]). Since spatial patterns emerge on relatively

short length scales, Crick suggested that spatial information may be supplied by diffusion gradients [62], although local mechanisms, such as cell cell communication, are also important [63]. Consequently, mathematical models of reaction diffusion processes—which take into account both chemical diffusion and cellular responses to evolving chemical gradients—have been widely used to study tissue growth and development.
Monolayer tissue growth in vitro
One of the simplest reaction diffusion models is Fisher’s equation, which was originally used to study the spread of a favored gene through a population [64] but serves as a good model for expansion of an in vitro monolayer cell colony due to proliferation and cellular migration. Denoting the cell number density (the number of cells/m2 for monolayer culture) at position x and time t by nðx; tÞ, Fisher’s equation reads the following:
@n
@t 5 rnðN 2 nÞ 1 Dr2n (2.3)
This equation describes the rate of change of cell number density in space and time. The first term on the RHS of Eq. (2.3) describes cellular proliferation. At low cell number densities proliferation is approximately exponential, with linear growth rate rn; however, as the cell number density reaches N, the maximum at confluence, the proliferation rate tends to zero accounting for inhibition of cell division due to cellular crowding. This model is known as logistic growth and is a good first approximation to two-dimensional expansion of an unstructured population of identical cells. Hierarchically, structured populations that contain subpopulations of stem, progenitor, or transit amplifying cells may exhibit more complex patterns of proliferation not captured by the logistic model (Fig. 2.2). Mathematical models of growth kinetics in such heterogeneous populations have been considered by a number of authors [48,65 67]. The second term on the RHS of Eq. (2.3) describes cell motility and states that cells move in a random manner with motility coefficient D; similar to a diffusion coefficient. More complex forms of motility, including chemotaxis or haptotaxis, may be included by adapting this migration term [68]. In one spatial dimension, assuming appropriate initial conditions, Fisher’s equation predicts that the colony advances as a “traveling wave” (meaning that the invasion front maintains a constant shape, moving at a constant speed) with
wave speed v 5 2 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
rND
p [64]. In the case that growth is spherical and axisymmetric (for instance, a radially expanding colony), the wave speed approaches this constant asymptotically for large radius [64]. Since the wave speed depends upon both the diffusion coefficient and the linear growth rate, reaction diffusion fronts may
advance much faster than by diffusion alone, and in a precisely quantifiable way. Consequently, Fisher’s equation provides an illustrative example of how a simple mathematical model may be used to investigate the relationship between proliferative and migratory parameters and colony growth rate. If the linear growth rate is known (for instance, from an independent proliferation assay), then cellular motility coefficients may be estimated using this relationship. For instance, Maini et al. have used this model to analyze an invasion front in a wound-healing assay for human peritoneal mesothelial cells [69,70] and we have previously used this relationship to estimate the migration rate of primary HBMSCs [71]. We found that for slowly proliferating migratory cell types, such as HBMSC populations, Fisher’s equation provides a good model for colony growth; however, for highly proliferative populations, such as the MG63 human osteosarcoma cell line, a sharp-front variation of Fisher’s model is more appropriate [71].
Tissue growth on complex surfaces in vitro
Fisher’s equation as outlined earlier describes monolayer growth. However, tissue engineering strategies commonly rely on seeding appropriate cell populations onto complex 3D porous biomimetic scaffolds in order to provide geometric support for tissue development [1,72]. In this situation, while good peripheral tissue growth is usually observed, poor growth or necrotic cell death is often seen in the central regions of such constructs (though this is not always acknowledged). Spatial heterogeneity of this kind is usually related to inadequate nutrient supply and/ or accumulation of toxic waste products at the scaffold interior, problems that we shall discuss in the following section. However, spatial tissue inhomogeneity may also arise from poor cellular ingrowth due to uneven initial seeding of cells and/or locally adverse scaffold geometries. Numerous groups have investigated the effects of seeding strategies, scaffold geometry, and nutrient supply on subsequent tissue growth, using both experimental and computational methods [73 75]. For instance, we have investigated HBMSC population ingrowth in a complex geometry using an experimental computational approach, which simulated Fisher’s equation over a surface obtained from microcomputerized tomography scanning of trabecular bone [75] and compared simulations with experimentally derived invasion fronts. We observed that despite the complex geometry, Fisher’s equation described tissue ingrowth over the trabecular bone surface surprisingly well, with the average migration front advancing at an approximately constant speed dependent upon geometric properties of the bone surface, such as porosity and tortuosity [75] (see Fig. 2.3D F). Applications of simple models of this kind are useful, since they allow quantitative

assessment of how scaffold architecture affects key proliferation and migratory parameters that govern the efficacy of tissue ingrowth.
Three-dimensional tissue growth in vitro
Nutrient-limited growth has been observed for a wide variety of engineered tissues, including articular cartilage, intervertebral fibrocartilage, and cardiac tissue [74,76,77]. In the absence of enhanced transport of nutrients and cellular waste products, spatial heterogeneities in cell numbers rapidly develop: peripheral cells have access to ample nutrient that they consume, leaving those on the interior nutrient starved. Consequently, diffusion-limited viable scaffold-based tissue growth is typically restricted to a few hundred micrometers (approximately the intercapillary distance in vivo). Spatial variability in cell numbers can also lead to variability in deposited extracellular matrix components that can severely inhibit the formation of mechanically competent tissue (see Fig. 2.4). The problem of nutrient-limited growth and resultant tissue integrity has been examined from a computational perspective by numerous groups in both the context of tissue engineering [74,78 80] and avascular solid tumor growth [81]. For example, we used the following mathematical model to investigate the relationship between evolving oxygen concentration profiles and nutrient-limited tissue
formation in the early stages of growth in developing engineered cartilage tissue [74]:

where cðx; tÞ and nðx; tÞ represent oxygen concentration (mol/m3) and chondrocyte cell number density (number of cells/m3 for 3D culture) at position x and time t, respectively. These equations describe the rate of change of oxygen concentration and cell numbers in both space and time. The first one describes the evolution of the oxygen concentration in the developing tissue: the first term on the RHS of this equation accounts for transport of oxygen, which is assumed to occur by diffusion with constant diffusion coefficient D; the second term accounts for oxygen depletion and states that oxygen is consumed at a rate proportional to the local cell number density. The second equation describes changes in cell number density: the term on the RHS accounts for cellular proliferation at a rate proportional to the oxygen concentration (cell death and migration are assumed to be negligible during the initial phase of tissue growth, which these models consider). The parameters α and β control the relative rates of cellular proliferation and oxygen consumption. Note that the cell number density and the oxygen concentration are intrinsically coupled to each other: changes in oxygen

concentration affect cellular proliferation, which in turn effect changes in oxygen levels. To close the system, we assume that oxygen levels are initially constant and the scaffold is uniformly seeded with chondrocytes and take a no-flux boundary condition at the scaffold center and a continuity condition on the scaffold surface for the oxygen concentration. Although this model is somewhat simplified, it was nevertheless found to provide a good fit to experimentally derived evolving oxygen and cell number density profiles, indicating that oxygen availability is a rate-limiting process during the early stages of in vitro cartilaginous tissue formation. Furthermore, this analysis indicated that in the absence of enhanced transport processes or regulation of cellular proliferation, spatial heterogeneities are inevitable: nutrient supply by diffusion alone will always result in proliferation-dominated peripheral regions that severely restrict viable tissue growth, and therefore potential for clinical scale-up. This problem has been tackled both by enhancing nutrient transport, for instance using bioreactors, in which transport is enhanced by advection or perfusion [82,83], or using printed scaffolds that possess an artificial “vasculature,” which can channel nutrients to the tissue center [84]; and by coculture with endothelial cells in order to encourage the concomitant formation of de novo vasculature within the developing tissue [85].
Pattern formation
During development, extraordinarily complex spatiotemporal structures emerge spontaneously, and it is these intricate “patterns” that ultimately provide tissues and organs with the microscopic and macroscopic structure necessary to their function. Reproducing such patternforming processes in vitro is a major goal of tissue engineering, and a quantitative understanding of these selforganizing processes will be needed to reproducibly and reliably engineer macroscopically structured functional tissues ex vivo. Remarkable progress has been made toward understanding the biochemical and biophysical basis of morphogenesis from both experimental and theoretical perspectives (see Ref. [86] and references therein for some examples). In the 1950s Turing presented a simple chemical mechanism, by which spatial patterns may arise spontaneously in biological systems [87], which has become acknowledged as a milestone in our understanding of development [88]. Turing’s mechanism relies upon diffusion of a chemical “morphogen” destabilizing a spatially homogeneous state, and driving evolution toward a stable spatially heterogeneous, or patterned, state. This mechanism is both simple and remarkable, since diffusion usually has a homogenizing, or stabilizing, role. However,
it can give rise to an extraordinary range of complex patterns. Consequently, it has received much attention in the mathematical biology literature [89]. The biochemical and biophysical basis of morphogenesis has developed considerably, since Turing’s initial work and his concepts have been used to help understand a range of mammalian developmental systems, including vertebrate limb bud development, angiogenesis, and wound healing [64,89,90]. Recent developments have also begun to take into account both chemical mechanisms and biomechanical forces (which are known to play a critical part in the development of tissues, such as bone [63]) in morphogenesis [91,92]. An archetypical model of pattern formation is the activator inhibitor model of Gierer and Meinhardt [93]. The generalized Gierer Meinhardt (GM) model consists of the following coupled equations, which describe reactions between an activator with concentration uðx; tÞ (mol/m3) and an antagonist, or inhibitor, with concentration vðx; tÞ (mol/m3) at position x and time t:
@u
@t 5 Dur2u 1 ρu 1 ρu2
1 1 κu2
ð Þv 2 μuu (2.6)
@v
@t 5 Dvr2v 1 ρv1ρu2 2 μvv (2.7)
These equations describe the rate of change of activator and inhibitor concentrations in space and time. Here Du; Dv; ρu; ρv; ρ; μu; and μv are positive constants, which characterize the rates of diffusion, production, and decay of the two species. The first terms on the RHS of Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7) account for diffusion; the second and third terms account for production: the activator enhances its own production (forming an autocatalytic positive feedback loop) and that of the inhibitor, while the inhibitor represses production of the activator; the fourth terms account for the decay of both species with constant half-lives. If the inhibitor diffuses more quickly than the activator, then this model can give rise to a variety of different spatially inhomogeneous patterns (including various types of spots and strips, see Fig. 2.5 for some examples). The essential mechanism, by which these patterns arise, depends on spatial control of positive feedback: small fluctuations away from the spatially homogeneous state are initially strongly locally amplified by the positive feedback present in the system due to activator autocatalysis; however, this amplification does not continue uninhibited but rather is spatially confined due to fast diffusion of the inhibitor away from regions of local activation. This type of short-range activation and long-range inhibition underpins many examples of biological pattern formation. For instance, using a joint experimental computational approach, Garfinkel et al. have recently shown that this mechanism can account for complex patterns formed by adult vascular mesenchymal
44 CHAPTER | 2 From mathematical modeling and machine learning to clinical reality


cells (VMCs) in monolayer culture in vitro [94]. VMCs differentiate and self-organize into variety of complex spatial patterns, similar to those seen in the GM model, during development, disease progression, as well as in vitro culture. Garfinkel et al. reasoned that bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), which is expressed by VMCs and positively regulates its own transcription, may act as a local activator; while matrix gammacarboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP), a relatively small molecule that inhibits BMP-2 induced differentiation, may play the part of a fast diffusing long-range inhibitor (see Ref. [94] and references therein). They found that experimental culture of VMCs demonstrated good qualitative agreement with the patterns formed in a generalized GM model based on spatiotemporal interactions between BMP-2 and MGP. In addition, their analysis predicted that different patterns would emerge from the same underlying mechanism if the kinetics of BMP-2 activation and MGP inhibition were perturbed. To test this, they showed experimentally that addition of MGP to the media preparation shifted the observed pattern from labyrinthine stripes to spots, while addition of warfarin (which blocks MGP inhibition of BMP-2, see Ref. [94] and references therein) resulted in “stripe-doubling,” two changes that were predicted by their mathematical model. Despite the relative success of activator inhibitor models, such as this, Turing-type patterns are difficult to engineer synthetically, since they are sensitive to parameter changes and rely on particular disparities in kinetic and transport parameters. Consequently, the importance of these mechanisms in development has been long debated [95]. However, Turing did not intend his model
to be an accurate description of any particular morphogenetic process, nor did he intend it to make hard biological predictions. Rather, the power of his work was that it initiated a new way of thinking about how complex selforganizing patterns may arise when feedback is spatially controlled. Perhaps, the greatest advantage to the tissue engineer of mathematical models of this kind is that they provide examples of how simple chemical, biological, and physical processes can interact spontaneously to produce complex spatial patterns in ways that are hard to explore using experiment and intuition alone. In the long term, better understanding of the complex self-organizing mechanisms of tissue and organ morphogenesis from such a mathematical perspective may allow more efficient and reproducible engineering of macroscopically structured tissue.
Machine learning in tissue engineering
Recent years have seen significant advances in the development of sensitive biochemical assays that reveal previously inaccessible aspects of cell and tissue biology. A representative example of these advances is single-cell sequencing technologies, which now enables the (parallel) genome-wide quantification of transcript abundance, gene accessibility, epigenetic modifications, 3D genome organization at single-cell resolution, providing information on thousands of features from different intracellular information levels [96]. While mathematical models have been tremendously successful in understanding, in detail, the interactions of a limited number of genes and their products (see Refs. [97 99]

FIGURE 2.5 Spontaneous pattern formation in a simple reaction diffusion model. Simulations of the generalized Gierer Meinhardt model [93], a classic activator inhibitor reaction diffusion process given in Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7), show how different kinds of spatial patterns can emerge spontaneously from the same model equations with different parameters. This model has been used to explain experimentally observed patterns formed by adult vascular mesenchymal cells in culture [94]: (top row) emergence of regular spots and (bottom row) emergence of stripes.

for some recent examples), obtaining and dissecting a full mathematical representation of large numbers of genes and proteins remains challenging, since mathematical models quickly become analytically intractable due to the large number of interacting parameters. Therefore rather than modeling data directly, tools from statistics and computer science are needed to extract predictive patterns from complex datasets, which may then be used to inform the development of mathematical models. The modeling task is thus partitioned into complementary phases consisting a statistical analyses or machine learning to reveal the structure in the data and to provide a simplified phenomenological description, followed by the generation of hypotheses of how observed structures may have emerged. The latter can subsequently be validated experimentally or translated into mathematical models to probe the basic biological principles that give rise to the observed phenomena, as described, for instance, in the previous sections of this chapter.
Supervised methods
Finding (or recognizing) patterns in high-dimensional data is a common problem in data analytics. Supervised machine learning methods address this task by “learning” how combinations of measured input features (e.g., gene expression levels) combine to elicit a given response (e.g., a desired cell function) that can be discrete (for classification) or continuous (for regression). If response variables are known (at least for a representative subset of observations, known as the training set), then the mapping from input features to responses can be learnt by comparing the discrepancy between true and predicted responses and choosing the mapping that minimizes this discrepancy. Once such an optimal mapping has been established, it can be used to predict responses for unseen data. The key challenge is therefore in finding such an optimal mapping. There are a number of different supervised methods that are widely used to address this task. Support vector machines (SVMs) learn a (high-dimensional) decision boundary for binary classification tasks [100]. SVMs have been used in tissue engineering, for example, to correctly predict the toxicity of drugs on tissueengineered brain organoids in vitro [101]. As another example, SVMs were able to positively identify mesodermal cells (expressing the protein Brachyury) using cell density and myosin light chain phosphorylation levels (as a proxy of local tissue tension) as input features [102]. Random forests (RFs) are ensembles of decision trees, which can be used for classification or regression [103]. RFs have been used to successfully explore a number of single-cell expression datasets, including to predict muscle stem cell quiescence from expression profiles [104]; interrogate the effect of thrombopoietin on megakaryocyte
commitment in hematopoietic stem cells [105]; and identify the physical interactions between stem and niche cells in the bone marrow [106]. Increasingly, artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly deep neural networks, are being used to address problems in regenerative medicine. In particular, in the field of image classification and object detection, a variant of ANNs called deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved expert-level performance, for instance, matching the classification accuracy of dermatologists in detecting skin cancer [107]. The superior performance of deep CNNs stems from their ability to learn representations directly from data that independently extract important features, such as color, shape, and regularity, and encode specific structures, such as abnormal skin patterns, as a combination of learnt features. However, the complexity of deep ANNs (which can have several thousand to millions of free parameters that must all be learnt from the training data) necessitates much larger training datasets, typically containing .1 million labeled examples, which may be impractical for many applications. Transfer learning presents a common solution to this problem. Here, a set of well-annotated but unrelated training data is used to learn generic features that are commonly associated with the input data type(s) yet not specific to the particular problem at hand. Once established, it has been shown that such pretrained models may be subsequently retrained on a much smaller number of labeled examples that are specific to the problem of interest. In the case of skin cancer detection, a model, trained to recognize 1000 completely unrelated object categories (e.g., cars and animals) using 1.28 million annotated example images, was retrained on 127,000 images of different types of skin disease associated with 757 skin different disease classes [107], thus significantly reducing the amount of data and time required for training. We predict that such approaches will increasingly become implemented in standard analysis pipelines—for instance, in image analysis of cells and tissues—and will significantly aid the development of new biological insights.
Unsupervised methods
In the case where responses are not known a priori, methods from unsupervised learning can help find structures in data by optimizing a loss function that relies entirely on intrinsic properties of the data itself. Clustering is an example of such an unsupervised method. For instance, in K-means clustering [108], data are split into a prespecified number of clusters (K), which are determined using a loss function that aims to assign cluster membership in a way that minimizes the intracluster variability while maximizing the intercluster variability. The simplicity of this
46 CHAPTER | 2 From mathematical modeling and machine learning to clinical reality


approach has led to its widespread application to complex data, such as single-cell transcriptomic data [109]. There exist a wide range of similar clustering methods, some of which are specifically tailored to the datasets that arise from high-throughput assays. For instance, a range of graph-based approaches, developed to cluster highthroughput data [110,111], have been applied to singlecell expression data in an effort to eliminate some of the effects of outliers and take account of the intrinsic complexity and high levels of noise inherent to these data [112,113].
Machine learning of cellular dynamics
In parallel to the increase in single-cell data, a variety of computational methods have been developed to better understand stem cell differentiation dynamics. Single-cell omics methods are destructive and permit only a single measurement to be taken at one point in time. However, these static snapshots can be used to reconstruct the likely sequence of phenotypic changes that a typical cell will undergo during development, and such trajectory inference techniques are therefore increasingly being used to decipher the dynamics of stem cell commitment [114 117]. Although successful, a major difficulty with trajectory inference is that different trajectories can give rise to the same distribution of cell states and hence inferred trajectories may represent one of many possibilities [118]. In some circumstances, this limitation can be overcome using (even scant) prior knowledge about the interrogated system (such as knowledge of characteristic end points) to derive better approximations of the developmental trajectories, which can then be used to make predictions for further experimental validation, or as the basis for further mechanistic mathematical models [109].
Regulatory network inference
In the absence of prior knowledge on the (causal) relationships between genes and their products (i.e., knowledge of the structure of the underlying gene regulatory network), mathematical models may not appear to be immediately practical. However, knowledge of the causal interactions between features needed to establish a mathematical model can sometimes be learned directly from data using machine learning approaches. There are a number of methods for such “structure learning,” the most widely used being Bayesian networks [119]. Bayesian networks have proven useful for the prediction of regulatory interactions in a variety of biomedical contexts [120,121]. Bayesian networks seek to infer a graphical structure—essentially a network wiring diagram, in which each node represents a regulatory species (e.g., a gene or protein) and edges linking two nodes indicate conditional
dependence (some of which may be causal), while the absence of edges indicates conditional independence [119]—which is most compatible with the coexpression patterns observed in the data collected. For example, Sachs et al. [121] used a Bayesian network approach to infer a signaling network in human immune cells, in which nodes represent phosphorylated proteins and phospholipids, while edges between nodes indicate conditional dependence, interpreted as a functional regulatory relationship (e.g., activation, inhibition, or coregulation). The use of Bayesian networks allows for prediction of true functional relationships between genes and proteins of interest. However, due to technical limitations, they are not capable of inferring feedback structures and may contain both true and false negatives and positives. To improve their ability to detect the true underlying dependence structure, interventional data may also be used, in which the expression levels of specific nodes are altered through knockdown or application of small molecule kinase inhibitors to test which interactions are truly functional [121]. Recently, alternative network inference approaches have been developed to overcome some of the limitations intrinsic to the Bayesian approach, such as their inability to detect feedback loops, a network motif commonly observed in stem cell gene regulatory networks [122]. Among these, alternative approaches are methods based on information theory [123], and, increasingly, methods tailored to singlecell transcriptomic data [124]. Notably, aggregate methods that construct consensus regulatory networks from an ensemble of different methods frequently achieve the highest comparable prediction accuracy when benchmarked against known networks [125,126]. In summary, network inference methods can be used to obtain insights from large-scale biological data and the hypotheses generated through network inference can guide further in vitro and in silico experiments to identify the molecular regulatory mechanisms that underpin stem cell differentiation.
From mathematical models to clinical reality
Mathematical methods are routinely used in engineering to optimize complex processes for industrial implementation. Mathematical models can be tremendously powerful yet rely on prior knowledge to enable the formulation of hypotheses in form of a set of equations. In the absence of such prior knowledge, or where data complexity is overwhelming, machine learning can be used to first learn structure in data, categorize observations, and help generate hypotheses for subsequent testing by experiment or formulation of mathematical models. We anticipate that as tissue engineering protocols make their way from

development in the lab to routine use in the clinic, mathematical and machine learning methods will play an increasingly central role in their optimization and scaleup. Mathematical optimization approaches are already being used to design custom scaffolds for tissue regeneration [72,127 129]. For example, Hollister et al. have outlined a strategy for the rational design of porous scaffolds with defined architectural properties that balance conflicting mechanical and transport requirements (reviewed in Ref. [72]). This strategy uses a set of mathematical tools from homogenization theory—which allow macroscopic material and transport properties to be inferred from scaffold microstructure—to aid scaffold design in silico for practical implementation using novel solid free-form fabrication techniques. Such custom approaches have been successfully used to design optimized scaffolds for bone tissue engineering in craniofacial reconstruction, for instance [128]. As another example, Unadkat et al. have recently outlined an algorithm-based strategy to design biomaterial surface micro-topographies that optimally regulate cell function [130]. It is likely that advanced multidisciplinary protocols, such as these, which coordinate mathematical, computational, chemical, and materials engineering techniques, will lead to further advances in scaffold design in the near future. Indeed, design optimization is perhaps the area, in which there is the most potential for genuinely productive application of mathematical and computational principles to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Such sophisticated design strategies are likely to become essential to the future of tissue engineering and ultimately will help to take tissue engineering from experimental concept to clinical reality.

Introduction
A high demand for organs needed for transplantation exists in the United States. The staggering number is more than 100,000 on the organ transplant list with approximately 18 people dying daily while waiting for an organ [1]. In contrast, a patient requiring an organ donor is added to the transplant list every 10 minutes [2]. This urgent demand and limited supply of donor organs requires a significant change in the way we address the need for organ transplants. The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has been identified as a promising, innovative path for fulfilling this need. The goal of tissue engineering is to produce constructs that mimic a native organ or structure for replacement or to function as a bridge to encourage the body to regenerate the native structure in vivo. The constructs may include a scaffold component, a cellular component, and biochemical factors/molecules or a combination of these parts (see Fig. 3.1). These therapies have the capacity to replace, repair, or regenerate cells, tissues, and organs to restore normal function in the body. This new era of health care is a paradigm shift from treatment-based to cure-based therapies. This chapter covers the status of tissue engineering in clinical translation; where we are and where we are going with research and development. It will also provide information on products that are currently in clinical studies as well as those in the market. In this chapter, overview of an academic model with a pathway from proof of concept to final product for implant will be discussed. This translational process includes process and product development (PD), which then transitions to clinical manufacturing along with quality control (QC) testing and quality assurance (QA) oversight in clinical trials. When a project has both an integrated PD approach and a solid design for product manufacturing, a shorter pathway to the clinic may be facilitated. The regulatory
considerations for translation, including the relevant FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern tissueengineered products, and testing in a clinical trial, will also be discussed. Careful review and understanding of the FDA regulations and guidance documents can help accelerate the development process and streamline the pathway to treating patients.
Current state of tissue engineering
Tissue engineering is a term that can be traced back to the 1980s when Fung, a scientist in the field of bioengineering, submitted a proposal to National Science Foundation for engineering a living tissue [3]. This important proposal planted the seed that led to several other organizations and individuals to further develop the field. Drs. Robert Langer and Joseph Vacanti brought clarity and definition to tissue engineering in their article in Science (May 1993) where they referenced the

proceedings of the Granlibakken workshop and the discussions on tissue engineering as an interdisciplinary field bringing together engineering and life sciences to produce biologically relevant constructs. Interestingly, in 1994 when searching the term “tissue engineering,” only approximately 10 references could be found [3]. From then on, the field grew rapidly. With the field expanding, scientists wondered whether tissue engineering would result in a functional structure that could be implanted in the body. In 2001 another symposium was provided by BECON (National Institutes of Health Bioengineering Consortium), which further provided clarity on tissue engineering, which was described as one area of reparative medicine. Haseltine coined the term “regenerative medicine” to define the in vitro construction of tissues and organs for implant using natural human components and high-technology nonliving materials [4]. In 1999 Dr. Atala, a leader in the field of tissue engineering, discussed the arrangement of tissue-engineered bladder replacement clinical studies in a future perspective article [5]. These were the first published communications of tissueengineered products moving into the clinic. A later publication suggested the translational pathway of in vitro construction of an organ or tissue on the lab bench to manufacturing a clinically relevant construct for implantation [6]. In 2006 Atala et al. published in Lancet the stunning results of engineered bladders that were implanted in patients requiring cystoplasty [7]. The meetings, publications, and milestones highlighted here represent only some of the work that drove the field to where it is today. Regenerative medicine as a field has matured into a new era with regulations evolving to ensure safety of these complex products. There has been significant progress in the last few years in moving promising treatments to the clinic where numerous replacement tissues can now be generated de novo. Clinical studies in regenerative medicine include orthobiologics, musculoskeletal, urology, and wound healing. Some of the first examples of commercialized tissue engineering products are dermal substitutes such as Dermagraft (Organogenesis) and Apligraft (Organogenesis) [8,9]. Dermagraft (a skin substitute consisting of cells, an extracellular matrix, and a scaffold) was used for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and chronic wounds. Apligraft (a bilayered skin substitute) is approved for both diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers. After FDA clearance of these products’ premarket approval applications, both were released for public use. GINTUIT (Organogenesis and XVIVO, a cellular-based product with bovine collagen) is a sheet applied topically for mucogingival conditions [10]. This product was the first FDA-approved combination product by Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) arm of the FDA and the first for use in dental application.
When searching for the term “tissue engineering,” the growing field currently has about 113,000 publications in PubMed and close to 84 clinical trials posted on clinicaltrials.gov. The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine stated in their 2018 Q3 report that there are 41 clinical trials worldwide in tissue engineering (distinguished from cell or gene therapy) with around a third of those in Phase 3 trials [11]. There are currently a handful of marketed FDA-approved products. The field is starting to mature as more and more products reach market and technologies can accelerate following safety and efficacy demonstration in early clinical studies in patients.
Pathway for clinical translation
One of the most important aspects in the acceleration of clinical translation for regenerative medicine technology is to have a comprehensive understanding of the regulations that are required to move a product to market. Without knowledge of the regulatory requirements, one could spend excessive time and resources on the path to clinic. The clinical translational pathway starts with the end in mind: the patient, the condition to be treated, and the form and function of the final clinical product. So first and foremost, it is critical to have the clinician involved as the treatment and study model is being conceptualized. Clinicians have a deep understanding of what is required at the bedside; what current treatments are lacking and how the proposed product can be more efficient; what the cost considerations are; and what approach will provide a better quality of life for their patients. The clinicians also have the best understanding in terms of patient access and urgency for treatment. For example, if a physician is treating a stroke patient post episode and the treatment is most effective when administered immediately, culturing autologous cells from the patient for weeks would not be a viable option; however, having an off-the-shelf allogeneic cellular product could be a possibility. The general translational pathway is illustrated in Fig. 3.2. Transfer of technology from the lab bench to PD and then on to manufacturing requires an enormous amount of time and efforts to move products through the translation pathway, especially if these units are located at different sites. Methods often have to be observed and performed multiple times during technology transfer for all aspects to translate successfully. For example, if tissue-derived biomaterial is used to produce an engineered muscle product, harvesting a specific region of tissue from an organ is required before decellularization (cell removal). In order to harvest the tissue, it is important to understand the anatomy for identifying the tissue layers, proper orientation of the tissue as well as methods to dissect and separate the layers to obtain target segments. It is also crucial to understand what the ideal target
54 CHAPTER | 3 Moving into the clinic


tissue should look like after separation, the amount of force required to separate the layers without damaging the tissue, and what a normal biomaterial source organ should look like and whether organs should be discarded due to disease or damage. The technology transfer of just this one step may take several training sessions with multiple batches of incoming organs in order to encounter different scenarios that require troubleshooting. Since this is the first step to manufacturing the biomaterial, all subsequent steps in the process could not be worked on until this step is ironed out. Therefore having all teams at a single site to answer questions and address any issues that emerge can accelerate the translation process. One important academic model developed for clinical translation is an all-inclusive model where the research, preclinical studies, PD, manufacturing, quality testing, and QA oversight for the technology are retained inhouse, and projects move from proof of concept all the way to early phase clinical trials in one location. Benefits of this model include a multidisciplinary team that can meet regularly and tackle issues quickly as they arise. The site is equipped with the academic power to develop innovative technology by established researchers funded to solve specific issues in health care. The researcher can perform the in vitro studies and preclinical studies providing pilot data that support the technology. Definitive preclinical research studies can be performed under FDA Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) to test for efficacy, toxicity, tumorigenicity, and biodistribution. A research core facility provides equipment and expertise to facilitate data collection and translation. The in-house translational core or clinical translational unit includes PD, manufacturing, QC, QA, and a regulatory affairs team. The regulatory team prepares briefing documents and communicates with regulators. These embedded services can provide acceleration of PD and intellectual property (IP). An in-house legal team provides guidance on IP and licensing to investigators. Having all stages of the translational pathway under one umbrella can save time and resources, allowing for development of multiple clinical products
simultaneously to be incorporated early on and throughout the process. When definitive preclinical research studies are performed under the all-inclusive academic model, they can be performed with the knowledge of the data that will be used to support an FDA IND (Investigational New Drug) submission, which means that studies will be conducted under GLP documentation standards. Often, if research is conducted in an academic setting, the investigator and any collaborators plan the animal studies with only the goal of publication in mind. When the project shows promise for translation after the study, the results can be included in FDA IND submissions. Under the allinclusive academic model, the study model and experiment plan can be discussed with the FDA during pre-IND (PIND) discussions to confirm the animal model, and the study fully supports the translation of the product to the clinic. A clinical translational unit in an academic environment can benefit moving technology to early phase clinical trials by submitting IND filings, transferring technology, producing clinical products, testing clinical products, and coordinating and training clinicians with product responsibilities. The scope of each project will be dependent on the phase of translation the project is in when introduced to the translational unit, thereby dictating the amount of involvement required by the team. The clinical translational unit has the goal of facilitating translation of scientific discoveries into clinical therapies, while meeting the requirements of the US FDA to ensure safety and compliance. The clinical translational unit develops and manufactures products and provides regulatory support to navigate the pathway to early phase clinical trials. An overview of this process is presented in Fig. 3.3. Following proof of concept and benchtop research activities, PD occurs with the aim of preparing the product for human clinical use. During this stage the laboratory investigator will transfer the technology to the PD team. The PD team then develops and refines the test

article for definitive preclinical GLP studies. Along with preclinical management staff, they assist with coordination and/or execution of GLP studies that meet FDA requirements. PD develops processes and sources materials suitable for human clinical trials, ensuring compliance with regulations. All materials in direct contact with the manufactured product need to be biocompatible and bioreactors, if applicable, should be constructed using USP Class VI materials. The transition of the technology from treating an animal to human requires most of the PD focus. When large animal models such as pigs or sheep are used, often the size of the construct and the number of cells required for the product are not significantly different than the human construct. However, if animal models used smaller constructs, then there can be significant effort in developing new bioreactors to support construct maturation, and new cell culturing techniques and media optimization to support expansion of cells to larger numbers. PD develops tests and assays to characterize the product going into manufacturing. To ensure the product is made consistently, the assays should have precise specification criteria. The testing should be performed inprocess and at the time of final product. A large number of technical studies are performed during the development process. For instance, certain reagents or instruments used to manufacture the product during the development phase may not be suitable for a clinical grade product. If possible, appropriate clinical grade reagents and surgical grade instruments should be selected. The technical study would
then compare producing the product with the traditional reagents and instruments and the newly identified materials. Other technical studies may focus on shifting the process to closed systems to reduce contamination risks or handling risks, which may harm the operator or the product. PD also gathers data required to support the INitial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on CBER ProducTs (INTERACT), or a PIND application, to the FDA. They perform PD process runs with testing to optimize and improve on the workflow. PD will identify product stability at all hold points throughout the process. Product packaging and logistics related to final transport to the clinical site is also developed. Once a process is refined and can be performed following written standard operating procedures (SOPs), the PD team works with manufacturing to transition development processes into formal SOPs and manufacturing batch records (MBRs). The PD team works closely with the manufacturing and QC teams to transition the projects into the good manufacturing practices/good tissue practices (GMP/ GTPs) facility. An overview of this late translation process is shown in Fig. 3.4. The role of manufacturing is to perform activities to produce cell and tissue products for clinical trials in accordance with GMP/GTP requirements or to manufacture FDA-registered products in accordance with GTP. The manufacturing team works with the PD team to transition processes into SOPs and MBRs for the GMP/GTP environment. They perform manufacturing engineering

runs within the GMP/GTP facility and optimize the process if necessary. The product logistics are further refined and all processing equipment must be qualified for installation and operation (IOQ). Preventative maintenance and calibration services must be performed on equipment regularly to ensure proper function. SOP and MBR documents are finalized with technical review, then reviewed and approved by QA. All manufacturing personnel must be trained to manufacture the desired product safely, effectively, and efficiently. The training should be clearly documented, and no operator will perform processing without documented training. Clinical processing includes a primary operator and secondary operator that assists and verifies that each critical step is performed properly. For certain processes, multiple primary operators may be required. To ensure sufficient materials inventory, control, and documentation in advance of each process, a materials kit is made with separate bins for different storage temperatures, such as room temperature, refrigerator, 220 C or 280 C freezer. Tracking numbers and expiration dates of all materials in the kits are recorded to ensure traceability. Before clinical processing can occur, two important qualifications to be completed are the aseptic process qualification (APQ) and the process performance qualification (PPQ). The APQ, or process simulation, uses a growth promoting media in place of all reagents and ensures the GMP/GTP facility maintains environmental control during processing to produce an
aseptic product while performing the procedure per SOPs. The APQ may not always be necessary if the product is terminally sterilized prior to administration to a patient, but the production area must be otherwise evaluated and monitored to ensure it is appropriately free of particulates and adventitious agents during production. The PPQ ensures that the finalized SOPs, MBRs, environment, and trained personnel can produce the desired product and pass all in-process and final release testing. The PPQ run (s) are also carried out as if producing the final clinical product; by doing so, any issues to the process can be identified and resolved prior to manufacturing the product for first in human application. An IND application or an investigational device exemption can be submitted at this point. The submissions are built on data from PD, QC testing, and manufacturing, which includes all technical studies and engineering runs. One notable caveat is that the PPQ may be performed (or may need to be repeated) after the FDA approves the application; thus, any changes required by the FDA are be included in the final PPQ. Once approval is granted from the regulatory agencies, manufacturing can begin, and patients can be recruited for the study. The manufacturing process for early phase clinical trials or registered products may include tissue receipt, cell isolation and expansion, scaffold preparation, cell seeding onto scaffold, packaging, and shipment to the clinical site. Samples are collected throughout the process and submitted to QC for in-process testing to characterize

the clinical product at various stages of production and then ultimately final release testing prior to delivery to the patient. During clinical manufacturing and QC testing, all activities require documentation to ensure concurrent recording of processes/testing and traceability of all inprocess chemicals, materials, and equipment. All written records must follow good documentation practices. Manufacturing and QC testing is monitored by QA to ensure procedures are followed to ensure patient safety. QA establishes policies and procedures and QC performs testing to ensure compliance with regulatory and internal requirements. QA has responsibility of ensuring documentation is reviewed and meets regulatory requirements after manufacturing has produced the product. QA is also responsible for a document management system and ensuring appropriate record archiving takes place. They also govern and control incoming materials, reagents, and consumables to ensure only released items meeting specifications are used in the GMP/GTP facility for the manufacturing of a clinical product. They are responsible for facility oversight, ensuring that PD and manufacturing activities take place in a controlled environment with equipment that is calibrated and validated to meet GMP and GTP requirements. QA is responsible for the master validation plan of the facility and will perform regular in-house audits of the process and facility. QA certifies the final product at time of release to clinical site by reviewing all documentation and testing results to ensure all procedures were properly followed and the product has met all specifications. QA maintains all relevant documents that support the GMP/GTP facility or any clinical product in order to be ready for FDA inspections that can occur at any time. A critical piece of translation is regulatory affairs, which manages and directs strategic and operational aspects of regulatory matters for technologies in regenerative medicine including cell and gene therapy, tissue engineering, biomaterials, and devices. This team maintains regulatory and compliance processes. It prepares, reviews, and evaluates documents for submission to regulatory authorities. The required expertise of this team is to provide focused regulatory drivers for accelerated pathways to control time and cost of translation. Project management (PM) is an important link to facilitate organization, communication and information processing within the translational unit for both preclinical and clinical effort. PM coordinates individual team member’s efforts and tracks outstanding items to prevent project delays. They promote efficient purchasing of reagents, materials, supplies equipment, and service agreements. Administrative tasks for the project are also performed by the PM. The overall head or director of the translation unit should have extensive experience in preclinical, PD,
manufacturing, QC, QA, and regulatory affairs, but with a strong emphasis on the production of a clinical product. The head of translation oversees strategic and operational aspects of global regulatory matters for all products moving to commercialization under FDA jurisdiction and research and development projects, including the regulatory and compliance processes, team management, milestone achievement, as well as the preparation, review and evaluation of documents for submission to regulatory authorities. Responsibilities for the head of translation includes setting priorities, providing strategic input, identifying and assessing regulatory risks, understanding global imperatives including market-related drivers, interfacing with regulatory authorities, keeping up with US and global regulatory requirements and guidance, and providing oversight and review of key regulatory documents. Under the direction of the head of translation, the teams work alongside researchers and clinicians to facilitate the translational process in a safe and timely manner that supports an overall mission of facilitating translation of the research from the bench to the bedside.
Regulatory considerations for tissue engineering
Regulatory requirements for biologics used in tissue engineering follows GMP and GTP regulations. GMP were initially developed for pharmaceuticals or drug production, which are easier processes and straight forward when dealing with defined products such as small molecule drugs as opposed to viable organisms or cells. Oversight of therapeutics derived from biological sources under the US FDA has provided clarity in regulations through guidance documentation and communication (written and presentations) to facilitate understanding of requirements to move a technology to the market. The FDA provides more guidance for investigators now than at any prior point in its history. This strengthened relationship with regulators provides an opportunity to transfer the science to the bedside in an efficient, safe, and cost-conscious manner. Growth in the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering has led to an elevated use of novel therapies to repair or replace tissues and organs and further requirements to provide safety in clinical products. Global regulatory standards were established with the goal of reducing the risk of communicable transmissible disease. As regulators are caretakers of the health-care structure, they need to be able to balance risks and benefits when assessing technology that may have lifesaving capabilities. In 2011 the US FDA issued a final rule requiring human cell, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based product (HCT/P) Establishments to be compliant with current

GTPs covering collection, donor screening, donor testing, processing, labeling, packaging, storage, and distribution of HCT/Ps [12]. The regulations for GTPs are found in 21 CFR 1271 Subpart D [13] and cover facilities, environmental controls, equipment, supplies and reagents, recovery, processing and processing controls, labeling controls, storage, and distribution of products. The regulation was drafted for products under the CBER. The GTP regulation covers human cells, tissues, and tissue-based products in addition to any cell product procured from a donor and implanted or transplanted into a recipient. FDA provides two tiers of regulation for HCT/Ps according to a risk-based approach. HCT/Ps under 21 CFR 1271 [13,14] and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) are regulated solely as 361 products when they meet criteria listed in 21 CFR 1271.10(a) [13]:
minimally manipulated; intended for a homologous use only as reflected by the labeling, advertising, or other indications of the manufacturer’s objective intent; and not combined with another article.
HCT/Ps not covered by Section 361 of the PHSA are covered under Section 351 of the PHSA (351), which is also regulated by CBER. This tier includes products that do not meet all the criteria in 21 CFR 1271.10(a) and are regulated as drugs and/or biological products. These products under Section 351 of the PHSA require premarket approval by FDA. Minimal manipulation and homologous use are further defined in a guidance document published by FDA in 2017 [14], which provides a resource for clarity on regulations required for the HCT/Ps. In summary, HCT/Ps regulated as a 361 do not require premarket approval and are covered under 21 CFR 1271 for GTPs. HCT/Ps regulated as a 351 product requires premarket approval and are covered under both 21 CFR 210 and 211
for GMP and 21 CFR 1271 for GTP [13]. The 351 products are regulated as an IND, while 361 products do not require an IND since they are geared toward the prevention of communicable diseases and infection, but they still include donor eligibility requirements. Tissueengineered constructs are generally combination products that include cells and a scaffold and are regulated as a 351, thereby requiring an IND. The scaffold is considered a device and regulated by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health and device regulations under the general review of CBER according to the primary mode of action of the product. A tissue-engineered construct requires an IND and compliance with GMP and GTP. GTP controls all steps in recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, storage, labeling, packing, and distribution according to 21 CFR 1271.150(a). Core requirements as referenced in 21 CFR 1271.150(b) include
facilities; environmental controls; equipment; supplies and reagents; recovery; processing and process controls; labeling controls; storage; receipt, predistribution shipment, and distribution of an HCT; and donor eligibility determinations, donor screening, and donor testing.
For a 351 HCT/P, GMP requirements cover areas such as documentation, validation, facilities, equipment, personnel, training, controlled documentation, manufacturing, process control, labeling, packaging, storage, and distribution. These are covered under 21 CFR Part 210

GMP for manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storage of drug products and 21 CFR Part 211 GMP for finished pharmaceutical products (Fig. 3.5). In September 2004 the US Department of Health and Human Services, FDA, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, CBER, and Office of Regulatory Affairs released a Guidance for Industry: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing—Current Good Manufacturing Practice to assist manufacturers in complying with the GMP regulations for pharmaceutical manufacture [12]. Then, in July 2008, the FDA issued a specific guidance for industry: current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) for Phase 1 Investigational Drugs to replace the original Phase 1 CGMP guidance issued in 1991 (20 and 21). The goal of this 2008 guidance is to further clarify the requirements for CGMP compliance, set forth more broadly in the 2004 and 1991 guidance documents, but for the manufacture of investigational new drugs used in Phase 1 clinical trials. It explains these drugs are exempt from complying with 21 CFR part 211 under 21 CFR 210.2(c) (Phase 1 investigational drugs); the original guidance was directed mostly at large, repetitive, commercial batch manufacturing of products. The 1991 guidance is still relevant for Phase 2 and 3 products, which means that once products reach this stage, they will be required to fully comply with 21 CFR 210 and 211. By Phase 3, products will also comply with 21 CFR 610, which outlines testing criteria to fully characterize the product. For example, potency tests should be fully developed prior to commercialization [15]. The progression of increasing compliance and regulatory oversight is graphically presented in Fig. 3.5. As the tissue engineering field is still considered up and coming, regulatory bodies are adapting traditional regulations and creating new regulations to accommodate the field. After feedback from translational teams, additional adjustments may be made by regulatory agencies; hence, throughout translation, regulatory considerations should be monitored closely to ensure compliance.
Conclusion
With an aging population in the United States and globally, and with demand for organ transplants exceeding availability, regenerative medicine becomes a critical goal of health care for sustainability as it will provide a significant improvement in quality of health care for the future. One important aspect of regenerative medicine is tissue engineering where the cellular material along with extracellular components and a scaffold are used in the construction of an organ or tissue. In this chapter the translational process was discussed from proof of concept to clinical trials. To reduce the total time for the translation process, regulatory considerations should be
monitored throughout the process to efficiently translate treatments to patients to improve their quality of life.

Molecular biology of the cell

To a naive observer the term “tissue engineering” might seem a contradiction in terms. The word “engineering” tends to conjure up a vision of making objects from hard components, such as metals, plastics, concrete, or silicon, which are mechanically robust and will withstand a range of environmental conditions. The components themselves are often relatively simple, and the complexity of a system emerges from the number and connectivity of the parts. By contrast, the cells of living organisms are themselves highly delicate and highly complex. Despite our knowledge of a vast amount of molecular biology detail concerning cell structure and function, their properties are still understood only in qualitative terms, and so any application using cells requires a lot of craft skill as well as rational design. What follows is a very brief account of cell properties, intended for newcomers to tissue engineering who have an engineering or physical science background. It is intended to alert the readers about some of the issues involved in working with cells and to pave the way for an understanding of how cells form tissues and organs, topics dealt with in more detail in the later chapters. As it comprises very general material, it is not specifically referenced, although some further reading is provided at the end. Cells are the basic building blocks of living organisms in the sense that they can survive in isolation. Some organisms, such as bacteria, protozoa or many algae, actually consist of single free-living cells. But most cells are constituents of multicellular organisms, and although they can survive in isolation, they need very carefully controlled conditions in order to do so. A typical animal cell suspended in liquid is a sphere of the order of about 20 μm diameter (Fig. 4.1). Most cells will not grow well in suspension, and so they are usually grown attached to a substrate, where they flatten and may be quite large in horizontal dimensions but only a few microns in vertical dimension. All eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus in which is located the genetic material that ultimately
controls everything that the cell is composed of and all the activities it carries out. This is surrounded by cytoplasm, which has a very complex structure and contains substructures called organelles which are devoted to specific biochemical functions. The outer surface of the cell is the plasma membrane, which is of crucial importance as it forms the frontier across which all materials must pass on their way in or out. The complexity of a single cell is awesome since it contains thousands of different types of protein molecules, arranged in many very complex multimolecular aggregates comprising both hydrophobic and aqueous phases and also many thousands of low molecular weight metabolites, including sugars, amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids, and phospholipids. Although some individual steps of metabolism may be near to thermodynamic equilibrium, the cell as a whole is very far from equilibrium and is maintained in this condition by a continuous interchange of substances with the environment. Nutrients are chemically transformed with release of energy which is used to maintain the structure of the cell and to synthesize the tens of thousands of different macromolecules on which its continued existence depends. Maintaining cells in a healthy state means providing them with all the substances they need, in the right overall environment of temperature, solute concentration, and substratum, and also continuously removing all potentially toxic waste products which the cells continuously produce.
The cell nucleus
The nucleus contains the genes that control the life of the cell. A gene is a sequence of DNA that codes for a protein, or for a nontranslated RNA, and it is usually considered also to include the associated regulatory sequences as well as the coding region itself. The vast majority of eukaryotic genes are located in the nuclear chromosomes, although there are also a few genes carried in the DNA of
