# Proteomics Claims Validation 2025

## Overview

This experimental project validates 8 biological claims related to aging mechanisms, proteostasis, and cellular dysfunction using pertpy (perturbation analysis in Python) and comprehensive statistical methods.

## Project Structure

### Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks for data analysis:
- **pertpy_analysis/**: Main analysis pipeline for claim validation
  - Cell cycle analysis
  - Claims 1-8 supporting biological statements
  - VATPase, ATP6V0A1, autophagy, proteostasis studies
- **development/**: Exploratory notebooks and method development

### Documentation

## Eight Claims Tested

This project systematically evaluates claims about:
1. VATPase function in aging
2. ATP6V0A1 gene role
3. Autophagy mechanisms
4. Proteostasis maintenance
5. Cellular stress responses
6. Protein aggregation
7. Lysosomal function
8. Age-related cellular dysfunction

## Methods

- **Primary Tool**: pertpy (Python perturbation analysis library)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Differential expression, pathway analysis
- **Visualization**: Volcano plots, heatmaps, bar charts
- **Data Format**: Results in PDF/PNG format

## Results

Comprehensive validation of proteostasis-related mechanisms in aging, with quantitative evidence supporting or refuting each claim through systematic perturbation analysis.

## Status

**Phase**: Analysis complete, preparing submission materials

**Key Outputs**:
- Jupyter notebooks with reproducible analysis
- Statistical validation reports
- Publication-ready figures
- Educational documentation for replication
