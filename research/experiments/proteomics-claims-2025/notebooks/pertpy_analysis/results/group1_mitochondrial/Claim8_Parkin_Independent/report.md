## Biological Interpretation

Based on the analysis of 5 proteins:

The claim "Parkin-independent mitophagy pathways are activated in tau+ neurons" is **partially supported** by the data.
While we detected some differential expression (1 proteins),
the pattern is not as strong as expected. This suggests partial or context-dependent validity of the claim.

## Methods

- **Statistical Test**: Two-sample t-test
- **Multiple Testing Correction**: False Discovery Rate (FDR) using Benjamini-Hochberg
- **Significance Threshold**: FDR < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 0.5
- **Sample Groups**: Tau-positive vs Tau-negative neurons
