## Biological Interpretation

Based on the analysis of 1 proteins:

The claim "Sliding window analysis reveals temporal patterns in disease progression" is **not supported** by the current data.
We found minimal differential expression (0 significant out of 1 tested),
suggesting no strong evidence for this biological claim.

## Methods

- **Statistical Test**: Two-sample t-test
- **Multiple Testing Correction**: False Discovery Rate (FDR) using Benjamini-Hochberg
- **Significance Threshold**: FDR < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 0.5
- **Sample Groups**: Tau-positive vs Tau-negative neurons
