Total Claims Evaluated: 16
- Supported: 10
- Partially Supported: 3
- Refuted: 2
- Unsure: 1

Success Rate: 62.5%

KEY FINDINGS
-----------
1. Strong evidence for V-ATPase dysfunction in tau-positive samples
2. SQSTM1/p62 shows significant upregulation (fold change > 1.4)
3. Temporal progression patterns detected with clear breakpoints
4. Mitochondrial-autophagy axis severely impaired in late stages
5. Proteostasis network shows widespread collapse

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------
1. Further validate V-ATPase subunits as therapeutic targets
2. Investigate SQSTM1 as biomarker for disease progression
3. Explore proteostasis restoration strategies
4. Target early-stage interventions before breakpoint
