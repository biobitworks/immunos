(Given context: Individual V-ATPase subunits (ATP6V1A/B2/C1/H) are correlated strongly and negatively with MC1, with expression highest at low MC1 and progressively reduced as misfolded-tau burden rose.)  
  
These results support a failed-compensation model under increasing pathology.

  
(Given context: the V-ATPase system also showed significant biphasic behavior, but with a later breakpoint (0.654) than the proteasome (difference 0.282 pseudotime units), and an early decline followed by an apparent late “recovery”.)  
  
These results reflect selective survival rather than restoration of function, linking acidification competence to neuronal persistence.

(Given context: Along the disease trajectory, an early proteasome inflection followed by a later collapse of lysosomal acidification coincides with a broad proteomic downshift, including reduced SLC2A1 (glucose transport), LMNA (nuclear architecture), and collagens.)  
  
These results associate tau accumulation to progressive dysfunction and differential survival outcomes.
