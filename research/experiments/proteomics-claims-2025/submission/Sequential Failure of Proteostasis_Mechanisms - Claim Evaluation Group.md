Analysis statement 1

A covariate-controlled differential expression analysis (age, PMI, and PatientID) across 5,853 proteins (BH-FDR) identified 2,115 proteins (36.14%) significantly altered between tau-positive and taunegative neurons.

Analysis evaluation 1

UNSURE: I do not know how to do this analysis, the results are unclear/insignificant, or the claim is ambiguous or missing key information.

Analysis explanation 1

I do not know how to do this analysis without significant research into differential gene analysis, statistical analysis, and research. I do not have enough knowledge of Python and packages to conduct a full analysis of .h5ad files without the assistance of AI, search engines, online forums, expert scientists, and a deep dive into troubleshooting and bug fixing. 

Analysis statement 2

The autophagy receptor SQSTM1 was the most upregulated protein (+3.41 log2) in the covariate-controlled differential expression analysis.

Analysis explanation 2

Analysis statement 3

Marked decreases were observed in the covariate-controlled differential expression analysis with collagens (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL6A2) showing the largest declines (> −4.0 log2).

Analysis statement 4

Within tau-positive cells, individual V-ATPase subunits (ATP6V1A/B2/C1/H) correlated strongly and negatively with MC1 (mean r = −0.723; range −0.581 to −0.791; all p < 0.005).

Analysis explanation 4

Analysis statement 5

The “V-ATPase Score” was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the log2-scaled expression values of the detected V-ATPase subunit genes. A segmented analysis of this V-ATPase Score against MC1 located a critical threshold at MC1 = 2.831 where a near-stable phase (slope −0.0029) transitions into a steep decline (slope −0.4255).

Analysis explanation 5

Analysis statement 6

The V-ATPase system showed significant biphasic behavior, but with a later breakpoint (0.654) than the proteasome (difference 0.282 pseudotime units), and an early decline followed by an apparent late “recovery” (slopes −0.202 then +0.304).

Analysis explanation 6

Analysis statement 7

Along the disease trajectory, the V-ATPase breakpoint occurs later (pseudotime ~0.65) than the proteasome’s, placing lysosomal failure downstream of proteasomal dysfunction.

## Interpretations

Interpretation statement 1

(Given context: Individual V-ATPase subunits (ATP6V1A/B2/C1/H) are correlated strongly and negatively with MC1, with expression highest at low MC1 and progressively reduced as misfolded-tau burden rose.)  
  
These results support a failed-compensation model under increasing pathology.

Interpretation evaluation 1

UNSURE: The claim is ambiguous, missing key information, or unable to be evaluated.

Interpretation explanation 1

Interpretation statement 2

(Given context: the V-ATPase system also showed significant biphasic behavior, but with a later breakpoint (0.654) than the proteasome (difference 0.282 pseudotime units), and an early decline followed by an apparent late “recovery”.)  
  
These results reflect selective survival rather than restoration of function, linking acidification competence to neuronal persistence.

Interpretation evaluation 2

UNSURE: The claim is ambiguous, missing key information, or unable to be evaluated.

Interpretation explanation 1

Interpretation statement 3

(Given context: Along the disease trajectory, an early proteasome inflection followed by a later collapse of lysosomal acidification coincides with a broad proteomic downshift, including reduced SLC2A1 (glucose transport), LMNA (nuclear architecture), and collagens.)  
  
These results associate tau accumulation to progressive dysfunction and differential survival outcomes.

Interpretation evaluation 3

UNSURE: The claim is ambiguous, missing key information, or unable to be evaluated.
