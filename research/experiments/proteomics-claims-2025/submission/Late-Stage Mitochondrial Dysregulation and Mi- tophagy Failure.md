(Given context: Stage-resolved metrics and dynamic coupling analyses together with running-correlation analyses show the SQSTM1–VDAC1 relationship shifting from negative early to positive late.)  
  
These results collectively support a late-stage mitochondrial dysregulation with mitophagy failure that is synchronized with lysosomal decompensation.
