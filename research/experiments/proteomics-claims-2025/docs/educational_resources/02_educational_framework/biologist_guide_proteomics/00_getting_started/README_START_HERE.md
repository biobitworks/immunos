## 🧠 What We're Studying

### The Biological Question
We're investigating how proteins change in Alzheimer's disease, specifically:
- **Group 1**: How do mitochondria fail in late-stage disease?
- **Group 2**: How do protein quality control systems break down?

### The Dataset
- **5,853 proteins** measured in brain tissue
- **Tau-positive vs tau-negative** neurons (disease vs healthier)
- **150 samples** from Alzheimer's disease cases
- **High-quality mass spectrometry** data

### The Analyses
You'll learn to perform:
1. **Differential Expression**: Which proteins change in disease?
2. **Correlation Analysis**: How do protein relationships change?
3. **Temporal Analysis**: How does disease progress over time?
4. **Statistical Validation**: Are our findings reliable?

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Use

### Software (All Free!)
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive analysis environment
- **Scientific Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scipy, scanpy
- **Visualization Tools**: matplotlib, seaborn

### No Need For:
- Expensive commercial software
- High-end computing resources
- Complex installations
- Advanced technical knowledge

## ⏰ Time Commitment

### Minimum Viable Learning
- **2-3 hours/day for 5 days** = Complete basic competency
- **1 week intensive** = Comfortable with all analyses

### Comprehensive Mastery
- **1-2 hours/day for 2 weeks** = Deep understanding
