## Relevance to Prion Clock

This paper discusses tau protein mechanisms, including **extracellular tau**, which supports the broader hypothesis that proteins can be transmitted outside cells and potentially between organisms.

## Key Findings

- Tau protein exists in both intracellular and extracellular forms
- Extracellular tau may have functional significance
- Mechanisms of tau release and uptake
- Implications for neurodegenerative diseases
