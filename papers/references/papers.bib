  abstract = {Abstract             Mitochondria are complex organelles with different compartments, each harbouring their own protein quality control factors. While chaperones of the mitochondrial matrix are well characterized, it is poorly understood which chaperones protect the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Here we show that cytosolic small heat shock proteins are imported under basal conditions into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where they operate as molecular chaperones. Protein misfolding in the mitochondrial intermembrane space leads to increased recruitment of small heat shock proteins. Depletion of small heat shock proteins leads to mitochondrial swelling and reduced respiration, while aggregation of aggregation-prone substrates is countered in their presence. Charcot--Marie--Tooth disease-causing mutations disturb the mitochondrial function of HSPB1, potentially linking previously observed mitochondrial dysfunction in Charcot--Marie--Tooth type 2F to its role in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Our results reveal that small heat shock proteins form a chaperone system that operates in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.},

  abstract = {Insight regarding how diverse enzymatic functions and reactions have evolved from ancestral scaffolds is fundamental to understanding chemical and evolutionary biology, and for the exploitation of enzymes for biotechnology. We undertook an extensive computational analysis using a unique and comprehensive combination of tools that include large-scale phylogenetic reconstruction to determine the sequence, structural, and functional relationships of the functionally diverse flavin mononucleotide-dependent nitroreductase (NTR) superfamily ({$>$}24,000 sequences from all domains of life, 54 structures, and {$>$}10 enzymatic functions). Our results suggest an evolutionary model in which contemporary subgroups of the superfamily have diverged in a radial manner from a minimal flavin-binding scaffold. We identified the structural design principle for this divergence: Insertions at key positions in the minimal scaffold that, combined with the fixation of key residues, have led to functional specialization. These results will aid future efforts to delineate the emergence of functional diversity in enzyme superfamilies, provide clues for functional inference for superfamily members of unknown function, and facilitate rational redesign of the NTR scaffold.}

  abstract = {The accumulation of senescent cells has an important role in the phenotypical changes observed in ageing and in many age-related pathologies. Thus, the strategies designed to prevent these effects, collectively known as senotherapies, have a strong clinical potential. Senolytics are a type of senotherapy aimed at specifically eliminating senescent cells from tissues. Several small molecule compounds with senolytic properties have already been identified, but their specificity and range of action are variable. Because of this, potential novel senolytics are being actively investigated. Given the involvement of HDACs and the PI3K pathway in senescence, we hypothesized that the dual inhibitor CUDC-907, a drug already in clinical trials for its antineoplastic effects, could have senolytic effects. Here, we show that CUDC-907 was indeed able to selectively induce apoptosis in cells driven to senesce by p53 expression, but not when senescence happened in the absence of p53. Consistent with this, CUDC-907 showed senolytic properties in different models of stressinduced senescence. Our results also indicate that the senolytic functions of CUDC-907 depend on the inhibitory effects of both HDACs and PI3K, which leads to an increase in p53 and a reduction in BH3 pro-survival proteins. Taken together, our results show that CUDC-907 has the potential to be a clinically relevant senolytic in pathological conditions in which stress-induced senescence is involved.},

  abstract = {Mammalian telomeres consist of (TTAGGG)n repeats. Transcription of the C-rich strand generates a G-rich RNA, termed TERRA, containing G-quadruplex structures. Recent discoveries in several human nucleotide expansion diseases revealed that RNA transcripts containing long runs of 3 or 6 nt repeats which can form strong secondary structures can be translated in multiple frames to generate homopeptide or dipeptide repeat proteins, and multiple studies have shown them to be toxic in cells. We noted that the translation of TERRA would generate two dipeptide repeat proteins: highly charged repeating valine--arginine (VR)               n               and hydrophobic repeating glycine--leucine (GL)               n               . Here, we synthesized these two dipeptide proteins and raised polyclonal antibodies to VR. The VR dipeptide repeat protein binds nucleic acids and localizes strongly to replication forks in DNA. Both VR and GL form long 8-nm filaments with amyloid properties. Using labeled antibodies to VR and laser scanning confocal microscopy, threefold to fourfold more VR was observed in the nuclei of cell lines containing elevated TERRA as contrasted to a primary fibroblast line. Induction of telomere dysfunction via knockdown of TRF2 led to higher amounts of VR, and alteration of TERRA levels using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) GapmeR led to large nuclear VR aggregates. These observations suggest that telomeres, in particular in cells undergoing telomere dysfunction, may express two dipeptide repeat proteins with potentially strong biological properties.},

Despite the apparent core role that protozoal species exert, their major biological and metabolic contributions to rumen function remain largely undescribed in vivo. Here, we have leveraged (meta)genome-centric metaproteomes from rumen fluid samples originating from both cattle and goats fed diets with varying inclusion levels of lipids and starch, to detail the specific metabolic niches that protozoa occupy in the context of their microbial co-habitants. Initial proteome estimations via total protein counts and label-free quantification highlight that entodiniomorph species               Entodinium               and               Epidinium               as well as the holotrichs               Dasytricha               and               Isotricha               comprise an extensive fraction of the total rumen metaproteome.

Despite certain protozoal species having well-established reputations for digesting starch, they were unexpectedly less detectable in low methane emitting-animals fed high starch diets, which were instead dominated by propionate/succinate-producing bacterial populations suspected of being resistant to predation irrespective of host. Finally, we reaffirmed our abovementioned observations in geographically independent datasets, thus illuminating the substantial metabolic influence that under-explored eukaryotic populations have in the rumen, with greater implications for both digestion and methane metabolism.},

Using this method, we characterized in situ ultrastructural and transcriptional responses of glial cells and infiltrating T-cells after demyelinating brain injury in male mice. We identified a population of lipid-loaded ``foamy'' microglia located in the center of remyelinating lesion, as well as rare interferon-responsive microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes that co-localized with T-cells. We validated our findings using immunocytochemistry and lipid staining-coupled single-cell RNA sequencing. Finally, by integrating these datasets, we detected correlations between full-transcriptome gene expression and ultrastructural features of microglia. Our results offer an integrative view of the spatial, ultrastructural, and transcriptional reorganization of single cells after demyelinating brain injury.},

We used the microwell array to characterize the antibody-secretion profiles of hybridoma cells and of a rare subset of antibody-secreting cells sorted from human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

We combined z scores from multiple biomarkers to describe haematopoiesis, inflammation, lipid and glucose metabolism, liver function, renal function, and cellular senescence domains. In Cox proportional hazard models, inflammation predicted all-cause mortality with hazard ratios (95\% CI) 1.89 (1.21 to 2.95) and 1.36 (1.05 to 1.78) in the very old and (semi-)supercentenarians, respectively. In linear forward stepwise models, inflammation predicted capability (10.8\% variance explained) and cognition (8.6\% variance explained) in (semi-)supercentenarians better than chronologic age or gender. The inflammation score was also lower in centenarian offspring compared to age-matched controls with {$\Delta$} (95\% CI) = -0.795 (-1.436 to -0.154). Centenarians and their offspring were able to maintain long telomeres, but telomere length was not a predictor of successful ageing in centenarians and semi-supercentenarians. We conclude that inflammation is an important malleable driver of ageing up to extreme old age in humans.}

We determined TSH heritability, its distribution, and association with SNPs in the TSH-B and TSHR genes. Results: Offspring had higher median serum TSH [1.68 mIU/liter (97.5\% confidence interval, 0.65 to 4.79 mIU/liter)], compared to controls [1.50 mIU/liter (97.5\% confidence interval, 0.63 to 3.93 mIU/liter); P ϭ 0.02], with estimated heritability of 0.33 (P ϭ 0.004).

Linkage disequilibrium between the two SNPs was high (r2 ϭ 0.95), suggesting interaction between them. Furthermore, GA haplotype frequency was significantly higher among centenarians and offspring compared to controls (0.57 and 0.53 vs. 0.46; P ϭ 0.0001 and P ϭ 0.01, respectively). Conclusions: A heritable phenotype characterized by raised serum TSH is associated with human longevity. Carriers of rs12050077 and rs10149689 SNPs in the TSHR have higher serum TSH, possibly contributing to decreased thyroid function and longevity. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 94: 4768-- 4775, 2009)}

Senescent cells are thought to impair tissue function, and their genetic clearance can delay features of aging. Identifying how senescent cells avoid apoptosis allows for the prospective design of anti-senescence compounds to address whether homeostasis can also be restored. Here, we identify FOXO4 as a pivot in senescent cell viability. We designed a FOXO4 peptide that perturbs the FOXO4 interaction with p53. In senescent cells, this selectively causes p53 nuclear exclusion and cell-intrinsic apoptosis. Under conditions where it was well tolerated in vivo, this FOXO4 peptide neutralized doxorubicin-induced chemotoxicity. Moreover, it restored fitness, fur density, and renal function in both fast aging XpdTTD/TTD and naturally aged mice. Thus, therapeutic targeting of senescent cells is feasible under conditions where loss of health has already occurred, and in doing so tissue homeostasis can effectively be restored.}

We have explored the role of PRMT5 and E2F1 in regulating the non-coding genome and report here a striking effect on long non-coding (lnc) RNA gene expression. Moreover, many MHC class I protein-associated peptides were derived from small open reading frames in the lncRNA genes. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 or adjusting E2F1 levels qualitatively altered the repertoire of lncRNA-derived peptide antigens displayed by tumour cells. When presented to the immune system as either ex vivo-loaded dendritic cells or expressed from a viral vector, lncRNA-derived peptides drove a potent antigen-specific CD8 T lymphocyte response, which translated into a significant delay in tumour growth. Thus, lncRNA genes encode immunogenic peptides that can be deployed as a cancer vaccine.},

  abstract = {Mef2 is induced after enrichment in mice, reduces disease-associated hyperexcitability, and is a feature of cognitive resilience in patients with AD. , Preserving cognition Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with cognitive impairments. However, few patients are resilient and preserve normal cognition. The mechanisms mediating this phenotype are unclear. Now, Barker et al. , using human data and experimental models, report that the expression of the transcription factor MEF2 was a predictor of end-stage cognition in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, and MEF2 expression was increased in resilient patients. In mice, enriched environment-- associated cognitive improvement increased MEF2 activity, whereas Mef2 KO resulted in cognitive impairments and neuronal overexcitability. Overexpressing Mef2a/c in a mouse model of tauopathy improved cognition and reduced overexcitability. The results suggest that MEF2 might be a valuable target for limiting cognitive impairments in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. , Recent increases in human longevity have been accompanied by a rise in the incidence of dementia, highlighting the need to preserve cognitive function in an aging population. A small percentage of individuals with pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease are able to maintain normal cognition. Although the molecular mechanisms that govern this neuroprotection remain unknown, individuals that exhibit cognitive resilience (CgR) represent a unique source of therapeutic insight. For both humans and animal models, living in an enriched, cognitively stimulating environment is the most effective known inducer of CgR. To understand potential drivers of this phenomenon, we began by profiling the molecular changes that arise from environmental enrichment in mice, which led to the identification of MEF2 transcription factors (TFs). We next turned to repositories of human clinical and brain transcriptomic data, where we found that the MEF2 transcriptional network was overrepresented among genes that are most predictive of end-stage cognition. Through single-nucleus RNA sequencing of cortical tissue from resilient and nonresilient individuals, we further confirmed up-regulation of MEF2C in resilient individuals to a subpopulation of excitatory neurons. Last, to determine the causal impact of MEF2 on cognition in the context of neurodegeneration, we overexpressed Mef2a/c in the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy and found that this was sufficient to improve cognitive flexibility and reduce hyperexcitability. Overall, our findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for MEF2 TFs in promoting CgR, highlighting their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for neurodegeneration and healthy aging.}

Previous work on gene function prediction has addressed this problem using independent classifiers for each function. However, such an approach ignores the structure of functional class taxonomies, such as the Gene Ontology (GO). Over a hierarchy of functional classes, a group of independent classifiers where each one predicts gene membership to a particular class can produce a hierarchically inconsistent set of predictions, where for a given gene a specific class may be predicted positive while its inclusive parent class is predicted negative. Taking the hierarchical structure into account resolves such inconsistencies and provides an opportunity for leveraging all classifiers in the hierarchy to achieve higher specificity of predictions.}

  abstract = {Herein, we will review molecular aspects of vestibular ear development and present them in the context of evolutionary changes and hair cell regeneration. Several genes guide the development of anterior and posterior canals. Although some of these genes are also important for horizontal canal development, this canal strongly depends on a single gene, Otx1. Otx1 also governs the segregation of saccule and utricle. Several genes are essential for otoconia and cupula formation, but protein interactions necessary to form and maintain otoconia or a cupula are not yet understood. Nerve fiber guidance to specific vestibular endorgans is predominantly mediated by diffusible neurotrophic factors that work even in the absence of differentiated hair cells. Neurotrophins, in particular Bdnf, are the most crucial attractive factor released by hair cells. If Bdnf is misexpressed, fibers can be redirected away from hair cells. Hair cell differentiation is mediated by Atoh1. However, Atoh1 may not initiate hair cell precursor formation. Resolving the role of Atoh1 in postmitotic hair cell precursors is crucial for future attempts in hair cell regeneration. Additional analyses are needed before gene therapy can help regenerate hair cells, restore otoconia, and reconnect sensory epithelia to the brain.}

To overcome this limitation and to study gene--metabolite covariation in cancer, we assemble the Cancer Atlas of Metabolic Profiles of metabolomic and transcriptomic data from 988 tumour and control specimens spanning 11 cancer types in published and newly generated datasets. Meta-analysis of the Cancer Atlas of Metabolic Profiles reveals two classes of gene--metabolite covariation that transcend cancer types. The first corresponds to gene--metabolite pairs engaged in direct enzyme--substrate interactions, identifying putative genes controlling metabolite pool sizes. A second class of gene--metabolite covariation represents a small number of hub metabolites, including quinolinate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which correlate to many genes specifically expressed in immune cell populations. These results provide evidence that gene--metabolite covariation in cellularly heterogeneous tissue arises, in part, from both mechanistic interactions between genes and metabolites, and from remodelling of the bulk metabolome in specific immune microenvironments.},

We then show that treating Caenorhabditis elegans with rilmenidine at young and older ages increases lifespan. We also demonstrate that the stress-\textbackslash - resilience, health span, and lifespan benefits of rilmenidine treatment in C. elegans are mediated by the I1-\textbackslash -imidazoline receptor nish-\textbackslash -1, implicating this receptor as a potential longevity target. Consistent with the shared caloric-\textbackslash -restriction-\textbackslash -mimicking gene signature, supplementing rilmenidine to calorically restricted C. elegans, genetic reduction of TORC1 function, or rapamycin treatment did not further increase lifespan. The rilmenidine-\textbackslash -induced longevity required the transcription factors FOXO/DAF-\textbackslash -16 and NRF1,2,3/SKN-\textbackslash -1. Furthermore, we find that autophagy, but not AMPK signaling, was needed for rilmenidine-\textbackslash -induced longevity. Moreover, transcriptional changes similar to caloric restriction were observed in liver and kidney tissues in mice treated with rilmenidine. Together, these results reveal a geroprotective and potential caloric restriction mimetic effect by rilmenidine that warrant fresh lines of inquiry into this compound.}

Yet, the ability to generate beige adipocytes declines with age, creating a key challenge for their therapeutic potential. Here we show that ageing beige APCs overexpress platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (               Pdgfr{$\beta$}               ) to prevent beige adipogenesis. We show that genetically deleting               Pdgfr{$\beta$}               , in adult male mice, restores beige adipocyte generation whereas activating               Pdgfr{$\beta$}               in juvenile mice blocks beige fat formation.

  abstract = {Background\enspace{} Epigenetic clocks can track both chronological age (cAge) and biological age (bAge). The latter is typically defined by physiological biomarkers and risk of adverse health outcomes, including all-cause mortality. As cohort sample sizes increase, estimates of cAge and bAge become more precise. Here, we aim to develop accurate epigenetic predictors of cAge and bAge, whilst improving our understanding of their epigenomic architecture. Methods\enspace{} First, we perform large-scale (N\,=\,18,413) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of chronological age and all-cause mortality. Next, to create a cAge predictor, we use methylation data from 24,674 participants from the Generation Scotland study, the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, and 8 other cohorts with publicly available data. In addition, we train a predictor of time to all-cause mortality as a proxy for bAge using the Generation Scotland cohort (1214 observed deaths). For this purpose, we use epigenetic surrogates (EpiScores) for 109 plasma proteins and the 8 component parts of GrimAge, one of the current best epigenetic predictors of survival. We test this bAge predictor in four external cohorts (LBC1921, LBC1936, the Framingham Heart Study and the Women's Health Initiative study). Results\enspace{} Through the inclusion of linear and non-linear age-CpG associations from the EWAS, feature pre-selection in advance of elastic net regression, and a leave-one-cohort-out (LOCO) cross-validation framework, we obtain cAge prediction with a median absolute error equal to 2.3 years. Our bAge predictor was found to slightly outperform GrimAge in terms of the strength of its association to survival \-(HRGrimAge\,=\,1.47 [1.40, 1.54] with p\,=\,1.08\,\texttimes\,\-10-52, and \-HRbAge\,=\,1.52 [1.44, 1.59] with p\,=\,2.20\,\texttimes\,\-10-60). Finally, we introduce MethylBrowsR, an online tool to visualise epigenome-wide CpG-age associations. Conclusions\enspace{} The integration of multiple large datasets, EpiScores, non-linear DNAm effects, and new approaches to feature selection has facilitated improvements to the blood-based epigenetic prediction of biological and chronological age.},

Here, we show that this loss of oocyte quality with age accompanies declining levels of the prominent metabolic cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Treatment with the NAD+ metabolic precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) rejuvenates oocyte quality in aged animals, leading to restoration in fertility, and this can be recapitulated by transgenic overexpression of the NAD+-dependent deacylase SIRT2, though deletion of this enzyme does not impair oocyte quality. These benefits of NMN extend to the developing embryo, where supplementation reverses the adverse effect of maternal age on developmental milestones. These findings suggest that late-life restoration of NAD+ levels represents an opportunity to rescue female reproductive function in mammals.}

Many studies show significant nDNA damage with age, associated with declining nDNA repair. Evidence for decline of nDNA repair with age is reviewed. Mammalian lifespans correlate with effectiveness of nDNA repair. The most severe forms of accelerated aging disease in humans are due to nDNA repair defects, and many of these diseases do not exhibit increased cancer incidence. High rates of cellular senescence and apoptosis due to high rates of nDNA damage are apparently the main cause of the elderly phenotype in these diseases. Transgenic mice with high rates of cellular senescence and apoptosis exhibit an elderly phenotype, whereas some strains with low rates of cellular senescence and apoptosis show extended lifespan. Age-associated increases of nDNA damage in the brain may be problematic for rejuvenation because neurons may be difficult to replace and artificial nDNA repair could be difficult.}

Cytokine profiling and bioinformatic analyses showed that Th17 cytokine production differentiates CD4+ T cells from lean, normoglycemic older and younger subjects, and mimics a diabetes-associated Th17 profile. T cells from older compared to younger subjects also had defects in autophagy and mitochondrial bioenergetics that associate with redox imbalance. Metformin ameliorated the Th17 inflammaging profile by increasing autophagy and improving mitochondrial bioenergetics. By contrast, autophagy-targeting siRNA disrupted redox balance in T cells from young subjects and activated the Th17 profile by activating the Th17 master regulator, STAT3, which in turn bound IL-17A and F promoters. Mitophagy-targeting siRNA failed to activate the Th17 profile. We conclude that metformin improves autophagy and mitochondrial function largely in parallel to ameliorate a newly defined inflammaging profile that echoes inflammation in diabetes.},

We report here that increased autophagy is necessary for reduced insulin-like signalling (IIS) to extend lifespan in Drosophila and is sufficient on its own to increase lifespan. We first established that the well-characterised lifespan extension associated with deletion of the insulin receptor substrate chico was completely abrogated by downregulation of the essential autophagy gene Atg5. We next directly induced autophagy by over-expressing the major autophagy kinase Atg1 and found that a mild increase in autophagy extended lifespan. Interestingly, strong Atg1 up-regulation was detrimental to lifespan. Transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches identified specific signatures mediated by varying levels of autophagy in flies. Transcriptional upregulation of mitochondrial-related genes was the signature most specifically associated with mild Atg1 upregulation and extended lifespan, whereas short-lived flies, possessing strong Atg1 overexpression, showed reduced mitochondrial metabolism and up-regulated immune system pathways. Increased proteasomal activity and reduced triacylglycerol levels were features shared by both moderate and high Atg1 overexpression conditions. These contrasting effects of autophagy on ageing and differential metabolic profiles highlight the importance of fine-tuning autophagy levels to achieve optimal healthspan and disease prevention.}

  abstract = {The crosslinking theory of aging has been gaining acceptance at a steady pace, as evidenced by many independent rediscoveries. While several earlier studies were indicative, none seemed conclusive until it was shown, using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), that protein from young human brains could be made to closely resemble protein from old brains by exposing it to either of two entirely different crosslinking agents (glutaraldehyde and dipotassium diperoxy sulfate). This work has now been repeated with additional brain material, and a statistically more significant number of determinations. It is now shown that a treatment of brain protein with either one or two chemically totally different compounds which have no property in common except that both are crosslinkers, changes young brain protein so that it greatly resembles old, crosslinked protein. This shows that crosslinking reactions are involved in the age related changes in the studied proteins.}

It is unknown, however, whether sleep deprivation leads to the loss of information or merely the suboptimal storage of information that is difficult to retrieve. Here, we show that hippocampal objectlocation memories formed under sleep deprivation conditions can be successfully retrieved multiple days following training, using optogenetic dentate gyrus (DG) memory engram activation or treatment with the clinically approved phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor roflumilast. Moreover, the combination of optogenetic DG memory engram activation and roflumilast treatment, 2 days following training and sleep deprivation, made the memory more persistently accessible for retrieval even several days later (i.e., without further optogenetic or pharmacological manipulation). Altogether, our studies in mice demonstrate that sleep deprivation does not necessarily cause memory loss but instead leads to the suboptimal storage of information that cannot be retrieved without drug treatment or optogenetic stimulation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that object-location memories, consolidated under sleep deprivation conditions and thought to be lost, can be made accessible again several days after the learning and sleep deprivation episode, using the clinically approved PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast.},

The radical initiator is the common metabolite S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), which is reductively cleaved to generate a 50-deoxyadenosyl 50-radical, a universal and obligate intermediate among enzymes within this class. A bioinformatics study that appeared in 2001 indicated that this superfamily contained over 600 members, many catalyzing reactions that were rich in novel chemical transformations. Since that seminal study, the RS superfamily has grown immensely, and new details about the scope of reactions and biochemical pathways in which its members participate have emerged. This review will highlight only a few of the most significant findings from the past 2-3 years, focusing primarily on: RS enzymes involved in complex metallocofactor maturation; characterized RS enzymes that lack the canonical CxxxCxxC motif; RS enzymes containing multiple iron-sulfur clusters; RS enzymes catalyzing reactions with compelling medical implications; and the energetics and mechanism of generating the 50-deoxyadenosyl radical. A number of significant studies of RS enzymes will unfortunately be omitted, and it is hoped that the reader will access the relevant literature -- particularly a number of superb review articles recently written on the subject -- to acquire a deeper appreciation of this class of enzymes.}

Age-related changes in DNA methylation at the genome scale have been termed `epigenetic drift', but the defining features of this phenomenon remain to be established. Human epidermis represents an excellent model for understanding age-related epigenetic changes because of its substantial cell-type homogeneity and its well-known age-related phenotype. We have now generated and analyzed the currently largest set of human epidermis methylomes (N = 108) using array-based profiling of 450 000 methylation marks in various age groups. Data analysis confirmed that age-related methylation differences are locally restricted and characterized by relatively small effect sizes. Nevertheless, methylation data could be used to predict the chronological age of sample donors with high accuracy. We also identified discontinuous methylation changes as a novel feature of the aging methylome. Finally, our analysis uncovered an agerelated erosion of DNA methylation patterns that is characterized by a reduced dynamic range and increased heterogeneity of global methylation patterns. These changes in methylation variability were accompanied by a reduced connectivity of transcriptional networks. Our findings thus define the loss of epigenetic regulatory fidelity as a key feature of the aging epigenome.}

  abstract = {DNA variants that modulate life span provide insight into determinants of health, disease, and aging. Through analyses in the UM-HET3 mice of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), we detected a sex-independent quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 12 and identified sex-specific QTLs, some of which we detected only in older mice. Similar relations between life history and longevity were uncovered in mice and humans, underscoring the importance of early access to nutrients and early growth. We identified common age- and sex-specific genetic effects on gene expression that we integrated with model organism and human data to create a hypothesis-building interactive resource of prioritized longevity and body weight genes. Finally, we validated Hipk1 , Ddost , Hspg2 , Fgd6 , and Pdk1 as conserved longevity genes using Caenorhabditis elegans life-span experiments. , Long live the mice (and humans) The question of what determines our longevity has preoccupied humans throughout the ages, and different researchers have tried to address this in a variety of ways. Bou Sleiman et al . approached this question on a large scale, examining the growth patterns and genetics of thousands of mice from a multicenter study of aging (see the Perspective by Magalh\~aes). From this analysis, the authors identified the contributions of various genes to the animals' longevity, which differed between male and female mice. The genes involved were well conserved between species, as evidenced by the finding of similar effects in humans and worms. In addition to genetics, early-life nutrition appeared to play a major role. --- YN , Variation in life span is the consequence of sex- and age-dependent genetic effects and early access to nutrients. , INTRODUCTION Aging is the progressive decline in physical, mental, and reproductive capacities that is accompanied by multiple morbidities and associated with increased mortality. Despite advances in identifying aging pathways and drugs that extend life span in model systems, an integrative understanding of the interplay between genetics, sex, and environment in aging and life-span determination is largely lacking. RATIONALE Although there is no single measure of aging, studies depend on surrogate or related traits such as longevity, life history, age-related disease onset, and physiological markers. Characterizing genetic and nongenetic determinants of longevity at the population level may identify genes and pathways involved in aging, providing avenues for targeted anti-aging therapies and extension of healthy longevity. We set out to query genetic regulators of longevity in a total of 3276 UM-HET3 mice used in longevity studies by the National Institute on Aging's Interventions Testing Program (NIA ITP). We interrogated whether the genetic basis of longevity is sex and age dependent, and whether nongenetic factors such as litter size and the effect of early access to nutrients on growth contribute to longevity determination. We characterized the age- and genotype-dependent changes in liver gene expression in mice from the same genetic cross. Finally, we integrated these results with orthogonal datasets to obtain a resource of prioritized candidate genetic loci and genes for further investigation. RESULTS When jointly analyzing males and females, we obtained a single, previously described, longevity locus on chromosome 12. However, when analyzed separately, males and females had distinct genetic determinants of longevity. In females, a single locus on chromosome 3 was uncovered, whereas in males, loci were detected only when early deaths were excluded, suggesting that some genetic variations had an effect on longevity beyond a certain age. Increased body weight associated with earlier death and some of the variation in adult body weight are explained by litter size. Hence, early access to nutrients may affect mouse longevity through its effect on growth. We used Mendelian randomization to replicate the relationships between early growth, adult size, and longevity in humans. To prioritize genes under the longevity loci, we profiled liver gene expression of adult and old mice to look for sex-, age-, and genetically driven differences in expression. Female livers had higher interferon-related gene expression, and older mice had overexpressed immune-related genes. Genetic regulation of gene expression was assessed, with the majority being conserved across sexes and age. We combined our results with data from multiple sources in model organisms and humans to compile an interactive resource for conserved longevity gene prioritization ( https://www.systems-genetics.org/itp-longevity ). Worm life-span experiments validated some of the most highly scoring genes and identified Hipk1 , Ddost , Hspg2 , Fgd6 , and Pdk1 as candidates. CONCLUSION This study provided insights into determinants of longevity, highlighting genetic mediators that can be sex or age specific, and nongenetic effects such as early access to nutrients. The combined body of information assembled from this study and the external data constitute a hypothesis-building resource for future studies on, and therapies for, aging, age-related disease, and longevity. Genetic analyses in UM-HET3 mice used in the Interventions Testing Program highlight sex- and age-specific longevity loci. Body weight associates with longevity, as does litter size, through its effect on body weight. Mendelian randomization in humans recapitulated these relationships between early growth and life span. Gene expression analyses, cross-species integration, and Caenorhabditis elegans life-span experiments highlight candidate longevity genes and provide a resource for further investigation.}

The mechanistic link between the aging process and disease pathogenesis, however, is still enigmatic. Nevertheless, measurement of lifespan, as a surrogate for biological aging, remains among the most frequently used assays in aging research. In this review, we examine the connection between ``normal aging'' and age-related disease from the point of view that they form a continuum of aging phenotypes. This notion of common mechanisms gives rise to the converse postulate that diseases may be risk factors for accelerated aging. We explore the advantages and caveats associated with using lifespan as a metric to understand cell and tissue aging, focusing on the elucidation of molecular mechanisms and potential therapies for age-related diseases.}

Mutations in the DREAM complex induce germline-like expression patterns of multiple mechanisms of DNA repair in the soma.

Comparative analyses can shed light on the diversity of mutagenesis across species and on long-standing hypotheses regarding the evolution of somatic mutation rates and their role in cancer and ageing. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing of 208 intestinal crypts from 56 individuals to study the landscape of somatic mutation across 16 mammalian species. We found somatic mutagenesis to be dominated by seemingly endogenous mutational processes in all species, including 5-methylcytosine deamination and oxidative damage. With some differences, mutational signatures in other species resembled those described in humans, although the relative contribution of each signature varied across species. Remarkably, the somatic mutation rate per year varied greatly across species and exhibited a strong inverse relationship with species lifespan, with no other life-history trait studied displaying a comparable association. Despite widely different life histories among the species surveyed, including \textbackslash sim30-fold variation in lifespan and \textbackslash sim40,000-fold variation in body mass, the somatic mutation burden at the end of lifespan varied only by a factor of \textbackslash sim3. These data unveil common mutational processes across mammals and suggest that somatic mutation rates are evolutionarily constrained and may be a contributing factor in ageing.},

This research has generated large amounts of experimental data that is increasingly difficult to integrate and analyze with existing databases and domain knowledge. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a scalable and effective approach for automatic evidence gathering and evaluation that leverages existing experimental data and literature-curated facts to identify genes involved in aging and lifespan regulation in C. elegans. Results: We developed a semantic knowledge base for aging by integrating data about C. elegans genes from WormBase with data about 2005 human and model organism genes from GenAge and 149 genes from GenDR, and with the Bio2RDF network of linked data for the life sciences. Using HyQue (a Semantic Web tool for hypothesis-based querying and evaluation) to interrogate this knowledge base, we examined 48,231 C. elegans genes for their role in modulating lifespan and aging. HyQue identified 24 novel but well-supported candidate aging-related genes for further experimental validation. Conclusions: We use semantic technologies to discover candidate aging genes whose effects on lifespan are not yet well understood. Our customized HyQue system, the aging research knowledge base it operates over, and HyQue evaluations of all C. elegans genes are freely available at http://hyque.semanticscience.org.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            A growing body of evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the human gut microbiota is associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) via neuroinflammatory processes across the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota affects brain health through the secretion of toxins and short-chain fatty acids, which modulates gut permeability and numerous immune functions. Observational studies indicate that AD patients have reduced microbiome diversity, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Uncovering the genetic basis of microbial abundance and its effect on AD could suggest lifestyle changes that may reduce an individual's risk for the disease. Using the largest genome-wide association study of gut microbiota genera from the MiBioGen consortium, we used polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses with the ``best-fit'' model implemented in PRSice-2 and determined the genetic correlation between 119 genera and AD in a discovery sample (ADc12 case/control: 1278/1293). To confirm the results from the discovery sample, we next repeated the PRS analysis in a replication sample (GenADA case/control: 799/778) and then performed a meta-analysis with the PRS results from both samples. Finally, we conducted a linear regression analysis to assess the correlation between the PRSs for the significant genera and the               APOE               genotypes. In the discovery sample, 20 gut microbiota genera were initially identified as genetically associated with AD case/control status. Of these 20, three genera (               Eubacterium fissicatena               as a protective factor               , Collinsella,               and               Veillonella               as a risk factor) were independently significant in the replication sample. Meta-analysis with discovery and replication samples confirmed that ten genera had a significant correlation with AD, four of which were significantly associated with the               APOE               rs429358 risk allele in a direction consistent with their protective/risk designation in AD association. Notably, the proinflammatory genus               Collinsella,               identified as a risk factor for AD, was positively correlated with the               APOE               rs429358 risk allele in both samples. Overall, the host genetic factors influencing the abundance of ten genera are significantly associated with AD, suggesting that these genera may serve as biomarkers and targets for AD treatment and intervention. Our results highlight that proinflammatory gut microbiota might promote AD development through interaction with               APOE               . Larger datasets and functional studies are required to understand their causal relationships.},

  abstract = {For most species, aging promotes a host of degenerative pathologies that are characterized by debilitating losses of tissue or cellular function. However, especially among vertebrates, aging also promotes hyperplastic pathologies, the most deadly of which is cancer. In contrast to the loss of function that characterizes degenerating cells and tissues, malignant (cancerous) cells must acquire new (albeit aberrant) functions that allow them to develop into a lethal tumor. This review discusses the idea that, despite seemingly opposite characteristics, the degenerative and hyperplastic pathologies of aging are at least partly linked by a common biological phenomenon: a cellular stress response known as cellular senescence. The senescence response is widely recognized as a potent tumor suppressive mechanism. However, recent evidence strengthens the idea that it also drives both degenerative and hyperplastic pathologies, most likely by promoting chronic inflammation. Thus, the senescence response may be the result of antagonistically pleiotropic gene action.},

AFP activity is commonly defined in terms of thermal hysteresis, which is the difference observed for the solution freezing and melting temperatures. Increasing the thermal hysteresis activity of these proteins, particularly at low concentrations, is of great interest because of their wide range of potential applications. In this study, we have designed and expressed one-, two-, and three-domain antifreeze proteins to improve thermal hysteresis activity through increased binding avidity. The three-domain type III AFP yielded significantly greater activity than the one- and two-domain proteins, reaching a thermal hysteresis of {$>$}1.6 {$^\circ$}C at a concentration of {$<$}1 mM. To elucidate the basis of this increase, the data were fit to a multidomain protein adsorption model based on the classical Langmuir isotherm. Fits of the data to the modified isotherms yield values for the equilibrium binding constants for the adsorption of AFP to ice and indicate that protein surface coverage is proportional to thermal hysteresis activity.},

The key element of antifreeze proteins is to act in a non-colligative manner which allows them to function at concentrations 300--500 times lowers than other dissolved solutes. During the past decade, AFGPs have demonstrated tremendous potential for many pharmaceutical and food applications. Presently, the only route to obtain AFGPs involves the time consuming and expensive process of isolation and purification from deep-sea polar fishes. Unfortunately, it is not amenable to mass production and commercial applications. The lack of understanding of the mechanism through which the AFGPs inhibit ice growth has also hampered the realization of industrial and biotechnological applications. Here we report the structural motifs that are essential for antifreeze activity of AFGPs, and propose a unified mechanism based on both recent studies of short alanine peptides and structure activity relationship of synthesized AFGPs.},

He rightly stressed that only a small minority of individuals infected by almost any microbe develop clinical disease. Intriguingly, though, he did not mention the abundant and elegant findings reported from 1905 onward that unambiguously pointed to host genetic determinants of infection outcome in plants and animals, including human inborn errors of immunity. Diverse findings over the next 50~y corroborated and extended these earlier genetic and immunological observations that Ren\'e Dubos had neglected. Meanwhile, the sequential advent of immunosuppression- and HIV--driven immunodeficiencies unexpectedly provided a mechanistic basis for his own views. Collectively, these two lines of evidence support a host theory of infectious diseases, with inherited and acquired immunodeficiencies as the key determinants of severe infection outcome, relegating the germ to an environmental trigger that reveals an underlying and preexisting cause of disease and death.},

Yet, these language models still fail to match the language abilities of humans. Predictive coding theory offers a tentative explanation to this discrepancy: while language models are optimized to predict nearby words, the human brain would continuously predict a hierarchy of representations that spans multiple timescales. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the functional magnetic resonance imaging brain signals of 304 participants listening to short stories. First, we confirmed that the activations of modern language models linearly map onto the brain responses to speech. Second, we showed that enhancing these algorithms with predictions that span multiple timescales improves this brain mapping. Finally, we showed that these predictions are organized hierarchically: frontoparietal cortices predict higher-level, longer-range and more contextual representations than temporal cortices. Overall, these results strengthen the role of hierarchical predictive coding in language processing and illustrate how the synergy between neuroscience and artificial intelligence can unravel the computational bases of human cognition.},

They have potential for the cryopreservation of cells, tissues, and organs, as well as for production and storage of food and protection of crops from frost. However, the detailed mechanism of action of AFPs is still unclear. Specifically, there is controversy regarding reversibility of binding of AFPs to crystal surfaces. The experimentally observed dependence of activity of AFPs on their concentration in solution appears to indicate that the binding is reversible. Here, by a series of experiments in temperature-controlled microfluidic devices, where the medium surrounding ice crystals can be exchanged, we show that the binding of hyperactive               Tenebrio molitor               AFP to ice crystals is practically irreversible and that surface-bound AFPs are sufficient to inhibit ice crystal growth even in solutions depleted of AFPs.

For both variants, we investigate and report the relationship between model complexity, resource consumption, the availability of transfer task training data, and task performance. Comparisons are made with baselines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning. We find that transfer learning using sentence embeddings tends to outperform word level transfer. With transfer learning via sentence embeddings, we observe surprisingly good performance with minimal amounts of supervised training data for a transfer task. We obtain encouraging results on Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) targeted at detecting model bias.

We find evidence that the transition to a senescent state manifests early, increases gradually, and corresponds to a concomitant global increase in DNA accessibility in nucleolar and lamin associated domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that senescent WI-\textbackslash -38 cells acquire a striking resemblance to myofibroblasts in a process similar to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is regulated by t YAP1/TEAD1 and TGF-{$\beta$}2. Lastly, we show that verteporfin inhibition of YAP1/TEAD1 activity in aged WI-\textbackslash -38 cells robustly attenuates this gene expression program.}

Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we identified and characterized the landscape of somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) in 56 single cardiomyocytes from 12 individuals (aged from 0.4 to 82\textbackslash,years). Cardiomyocyte sSNVs accumulate with age at rates that are faster than in many dividing cell types and nondividing neurons. Cardiomyocyte sSNVs show distinctive mutational signatures that implicate failed nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage, and defective mismatch repair. Since age-accumulated sSNVs create many damaging mutations that disrupt gene functions, polyploidization in cardiomyocytes may provide a mechanism of genetic compensation to minimize the complete knockout of essential genes during aging. Age-related accumulation of cardiac mutations provides a paradigm to understand the influence of aging on cardiac dysfunction.}

  abstract = {Abstract The accumulation of somatic DNA mutations over time is a hallmark of aging in many dividing and nondividing cells but has not been studied in postmitotic human cardiomyocytes. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we identified and characterized the landscape of somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) in 56 single cardiomyocytes from 12 individuals (aged from 0.4 to 82\textbackslash,years). Cardiomyocyte sSNVs accumulate with age at rates that are faster than in many dividing cell types and nondividing neurons. Cardiomyocyte sSNVs show distinctive mutational signatures that implicate failed nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage, and defective mismatch repair. Since age-accumulated sSNVs create many damaging mutations that disrupt gene functions, polyploidization in cardiomyocytes may provide a mechanism of genetic compensation to minimize the complete knockout of essential genes during aging. Age-related accumulation of cardiac mutations provides a paradigm to understand the influence of aging on cardiac dysfunction.}

  abstract = {An epigenetic profile defining the DNA methylation age (DNAm age) of an individual has been suggested to be a biomarker of aging, and thus possibly providing a tool for assessment of health and mortality. In this study, we estimated the DNAm age of 378 Danish twins, age 30-- 82 years, and furthermore included a 10-year longitudinal study of the 86 oldest-old twins (mean age of 86.1 at follow-up), which subsequently were followed for mortality for 8 years. We found that the DNAm age is highly correlated with chronological age across all age groups (r = 0.97), but that the rate of change of DNAm age decreases with age. The results may in part be explained by selective mortality of those with a high DNAm age. This hypothesis was supported by a classical survival analysis showing a 35\% (4-- 77\%) increased mortality risk for each 5-year increase in the DNAm age vs. chronological age. Furthermore, the intrapair twin analysis revealed a more-than-double mortality risk for the DNAm oldest twin compared to the co-twin and a `dose-- response pattern' with the odds of dying first increasing 3.2 (1.05-- 10.1) times per 5-year DNAm age difference within twin pairs, thus showing a stronger association of DNAm age with mortality in the oldest-old when controlling for familial factors. In conclusion, our results support that DNAm age qualifies as a biomarker of aging.}

  abstract = {Motivation: With the increasing availability of diverse biological information, protein function prediction approaches have converged towards integration of heterogeneous data. Many adapted existing techniques, such as machine-learning and probabilistic methods, which have proven successful on specific data types. However, the impact of these approaches is hindered by a couple of factors. First, there is little comparison between existing approaches. This is in part due to a divergence in the focus adopted by different works, which makes comparison difficult or even fuzzy. Second, there seems to be over-emphasis on the use of computationally demanding machinelearning methods, which runs counter to the surge in biological data. Analogous to the success of BLAST for sequence homology search, we believe that the ability to tap escalating quantity, quality and diversity of biological data is crucial to the success of automated function prediction as a useful instrument for the advancement of proteomic research. We address these problems by: (1) providing useful comparison between some prominent methods; (2) proposing Integrated Weighted Averaging (IWA)--- a scalable, efficient and flexible function prediction framework that integrates diverse information using simple weighting strategies and a local prediction method. The simplicity of the approach makes it possible to make predictions based on on-the-fly information fusion.}

  abstract = {Abstract As we age, our body experiences chronic, systemic inflammation contributing to the morbidity and mortality of the elderly. The senescent immune system has been described to have a causal role in driving systemic aging and therefore may represent a key therapeutic target to prevent pathological consequences associated with aging and extend a healthy lifespan. Previous studies from our group associated a polymorphic haplotype variant in the BPIFB4 gene (LAV-BPIFB4) with exceptional longevity. Transfer of the LAV-BPIFB4 in preclinical models halted the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and frailty by counterbalancing chronic inflammation. In the present study, we aimed to delineate the action of systemic adeno-associated viral vector-mediated LAV-BPIFB4 gene transfer (AAV-LAV-BPIFB4) on the deleterious age-related changes of the immune system and thereby the senescence-associated events occurring in C57BL/6J mice aged 26 months. Our in vivo data showed that 26-months-old mice had a higher frequency of CD45 + SA-beta Gal + immune cells in peripheral blood than young (4-months-old) C57BL/6J mice. Notably, AAV-LAV-BPIFB4 gene transfer in aged mice reduced the pool of peripheral immunosenescent cells that were shown to be enriched in the spleen. In addition, the proper tuning of the immune secretory phenotype (IL1{$\beta$} low , IL6 low , IL10 high ) associated with a significant reduction in SA-beta Gal-positive area of aorta from AAV-LAV treated mice. At the functional level, the reduction of senescence-associated inflammation ensured sustained NAD + levels in the plasma of AAV-LAV-BPIFB4 old mice by preventing the NADase CD38 increase in F4/80+ tissue-resident macrophages and Ly6C high pro-inflammatory monocytes of the spleen and bone marrow. Finally, to validate the clinical implication of our findings, we showed that Long-living-individuals (LLIs, {$>$}95 years), which delay CVDs onset, especially if LAV-carriers, were characterized by high NAD + levels. In conclusion, the new senotherapeutic action of LAV-BPIFB4 may offer a valuable therapeutic tool to control aging and reduce the burden of its pathophysiological disorders, such as CVDs.}

We develop a method that does not require specialized microfluidic devices, expertise or hardware. Our approach is based on particle-templated emulsification, which allows single-cell encapsulation and barcoding of cDNA in uniform droplet emulsions with only a vortexer. Particle-templated instant partition sequencing (PIP-seq) accommodates a wide range of emulsification formats, including microwell plates and large-volume conical tubes, enabling thousands of samples or millions of cells to be processed in minutes. We demonstrate that PIP-seq produces high-purity transcriptomes in mouse--human mixing studies, is compatible with multiomics measurements and can accurately characterize cell types in human breast tissue compared to a commercial microfluidic platform. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of mixed phenotype acute leukemia using PIP-seq reveals the emergence of heterogeneity within chemotherapy-resistant cell subsets that were hidden by standard immunophenotyping. PIP-seq is a simple, flexible and scalable next-generation workflow that extends single-cell sequencing to new applications.},

Recent mitochondrial transcriptome analyses revealed the existence of multiple small mRNAs transcribed from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Humanin (HN), a peptide encoded in the mtDNA 16S ribosomal RNA region, is a neuroprotective factor. An in silico search revealed six additional peptides in the same region of mtDNA as humanin; we named these peptides small humanin-like peptides (SHLPs). We identified the functional roles for these peptides and the potential mechanisms of action. The SHLPs differed in their ability to regulate cell viability in vitro. We focused on SHLP2 and SHLP3 because they shared similar protective effects with HN. Specifically, they significantly reduced apoptosis and the generation of reactive oxygen species, and improved mitochondrial metabolism in vitro. SHLP2 and SHLP3 also enhanced 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation. Systemic hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies showed that intracerebrally infused SHLP2 increased glucose uptake and suppressed hepatic glucose production, suggesting that it functions as an insulin sensitizer both peripherally and centrally. Similar to HN, the levels of circulating SHLP2 were found to decrease with age. These results suggest that mitochondria play critical roles in metabolism and survival through the synthesis of mitochondrial peptides, and provide new insights into mitochondrial biology with relevance to aging and human biology.}

We test the `invariant rate of ageing' hypothesis, which posits that the rate of ageing is relatively fixed within species, with a collection of 39 human and nonhuman primate datasets across seven genera. We first recapitulate, in nonhuman primates, the highly regular relationship between life expectancy and lifespan equality seen in humans. We next demonstrate that variation in the rate of ageing within genera is orders of magnitude smaller than variation in pre-adult and age-independent mortality. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in the rate of ageing, but not other mortality parameters, produce striking, species-atypical changes in mortality patterns. Our results support the invariant rate of ageing hypothesis, implying biological constraints on how much the human rate of ageing can be slowed.}

REAP is a low-throughput method which takes advantage of natural selection and uses ancestral protein sequences to direct gene mutations, thereby creating a library with a high density of viable proteins. These proteins must then be assayed to characterize their functionality to identify which variants have the desired traits such as acid stability or thermostability.},

However, editing normally requires efficient recombination and high transformation efficiencies, which are unavailable in most strains. Here, we show that systematically attenuating DNA targeting activity enables RecA-mediated repair in different bacteria, allowing chromosomal cleavage to drive genome editing. Attenuation can be achieved by altering the format or expression strength of guide (g)RNAs; using nucleases with reduced cleavage activity; or engineering attenuated gRNAs (atgRNAs) with disruptive hairpins, perturbed nuclease-binding scaffolds, non-canonical PAMs, or guide mismatches. These modifications greatly increase cell counts and even improve the efficiency of different types of edits for Cas9 and Cas12a in               Escherichia coli               and               Klebsiella oxytoca               . We further apply atgRNAs to restore ampicillin sensitivity in               Klebsiella pneumoniae               , establishing a resistance marker for genetic studies.

We suppressed epileptiform activity by treatment with the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam or by genetic ablation of tau and found that these interventions reversed or prevented aberrant microglial gene expression in brain tissues of aged human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice, which simulate several key aspects of AD. The most robustly modulated genes included multiple factors previously implicated in AD pathogenesis, including TREM2, the hypofunction of which increases disease risk. Genetic reduction of TREM2 exacerbated epileptiform activity after mice were injected with kainate. We conclude that AD-related epileptiform activity markedly changes the molecular profile of microglia, inducing both maladaptive and adaptive alterations in their activities. Increased expression of TREM2 seems to support microglial activities that counteract this type of network dysfunction.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Neuromorphic computers emulate the human brain while being extremely power~efficient for computing tasks. In fact,~they are poised to be critical for energy-efficient computing in the future. Neuromorphic computers are primarily used in spiking neural network--based machine learning applications. However, they are known to be Turing-complete, and in theory can perform all general-purpose computation. One of the biggest bottlenecks in realizing general-purpose computations on neuromorphic computers today is the inability to~efficiently encode data on the neuromorphic computers. To fully realize the potential of neuromorphic computers for energy-efficient general-purpose computing, efficient mechanisms~must be devised for encoding numbers. Current encoding mechanisms (e.g.,~binning, rate-based encoding, and time-based encoding) have limited applicability and are not suited for general-purpose computation. In this paper, we present the virtual neuron abstraction as a mechanism for encoding and adding integers and rational numbers~by using spiking neural network primitives. We evaluate the performance of the virtual neuron on physical and simulated neuromorphic hardware. We estimate that the virtual neuron could perform an addition operation using just 23 nJ of energy on average with a mixed-signal, memristor-based neuromorphic processor. We also demonstrate the utility of the virtual neuron by using it in some of the               {$\mu$}               -recursive functions, which are the building blocks of general-purpose computation.},

Plasma membrane rupture was long thought to be driven by osmotic pressure, but it has recently been shown to be in many cases~an active process, mediated by the protein ninjurin-1               8               (NINJ1). Here we resolve the structure of NINJ1 and the mechanism by which it ruptures membranes. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that NINJ1 clusters into structurally diverse assemblies in the membranes of dying cells, in particular large, filamentous assemblies with branched morphology. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of NINJ1 filaments shows a tightly packed fence-like array of transmembrane {$\alpha$}-helices. Filament directionality and stability is defined by two amphipathic {$\alpha$}-helices that interlink adjacent filament subunits. The NINJ1 filament features a hydrophilic side and a hydrophobic side, and molecular dynamics simulations show that it can stably cap membrane edges. The function of the resulting supramolecular arrangement was validated by site-directed mutagenesis. Our data thus suggest that, during lytic cell death, the extracellular {$\alpha$}-helices of NINJ1 insert into the plasma membrane to polymerize NINJ1 monomers into amphipathic filaments that rupture the plasma membrane. The membrane protein NINJ1 is therefore an interactive component of the eukaryotic cell membrane that functions as an in-built breaking point in response to activation of cell death.},

I recognize that many of these errors are by no means Kyriazis's alone but are shared by numerous observers across the full range of biological expertise. It is for that reason above all that I hope this exchange will be of value to readers.

For clarity, I will not structure this response as an essay, but instead as a simple point-by-point list of comments concerning individual statements and inferences that Kyriazis makes.}

The complexity of the inner cell composition and the intricate meshwork formed by transmembrane cell-substrate interactions demands a non-invasive technique to probe cell mechanics and cell adhesion at a subcell scale. In this paper we review the use of laser-generated GHz acoustic waves---a technique called picosecond ultrasonics (PU)---to probe the mechanical properties of single cells. We first describe applications to vegetal cells and biomimetic systems. We show how these systems can be used as simple models to understand more complex animal cells. We then present an opto-acoustic bio-transducer designed for in vivo measurements in physiological conditions. We illustrate the use of this transducer through the simultaneous probing of the density and compressibility of Allium cepa cells. Finally, we demonstrate that this technique can quantify animal-cell adhesion on metallic surfaces by analyzing the acoustic pulses reflected off the cell-metal interface. This innovative approach allows investigating quantitatively cell mechanics without fluorescent labels or mechanical contact to the cell.},

The aim of this study was to investigate gender specific differences in the inheritance of exceptional longevity. Using a standardized questionnaire, we assessed the parental ages of death of Ashkenazi Jews with exceptional longevity and their spouses without exceptional longevity, who served as controls (n=1,114). Mothers of centenarian males and females had significantly longer lifespans compared to the mothers of noncentenarians, 79.0 \textbackslash pm 13.4 vs. 73.0 \textbackslash pm 16.3 years, p{$<$}0.01 and 75.7 \textbackslash pm 15.8 vs. 70.5 \textbackslash pm 18.0 years, p=0.02, respectively. There was also a trend toward longer lifespan among the fathers of centenarian men compared to the lifespan of fathers of noncentenarian men, 73.5 \textbackslash pm 17.0 vs. 69.5 \textbackslash pm15.0 years, p=0.07. The lifespan did not differ between the fathers of centenarian and non-centenarian daughters. Logistic regression models revealed that the odds of being a centenarian for the female and male offspring increased by 21\% and 31\%, respectively, for every additional 10 years of life achieved by the mother (p{$<$}0.05). These findings support a gender-specific inheritance pattern of human longevity and may help focus the search for longevity genes.}

Interventions delaying aging in animal models are well established; however, most lack validation in humans. The length of human lifespan makes it impractical to perform survival analysis. Instead, aging biomarkers, such as DNA methylation (DNAm) clocks, have been developed to monitor biological age. Herein we report a retrospective analysis of DNA methylation age in 42 individuals taking Rejuvant\textregistered, an alpha-ketoglutarate based formulation, for an average period of 7 months. DNAm testing was performed at baseline and by the end of treatment with Rejuvant\textregistered{} supplementation. Remarkably, individuals showed an average decrease in biological aging of 8 years (p-value=6.538x10-12). Furthermore, the supplementation with Rejuvant\textregistered{} is robust to individual differences, as indicated by the fact that a large majority of participants decreased their biological age. Moreover, we found that Rejuvant\textregistered{} is of additional benefit to chronologically and biologically older individuals. While continued testing, particularly in a placebo-controlled design, is required, the nearly 8-year reversal in the biological age of individuals taking Rejuvant\textregistered{} for 4 to 10 months is noteworthy, making the natural product cocktail an intriguing candidate to affect human aging.}

We observed the highest degree of plaque-specific clonal expansion in effector CD4               +               T cells, and these clonally expanded T cells expressed genes such as               CD69               ,               FOS               and               FOSB               , indicative of recent TCR engagement, suggesting antigen-specific stimulation. CellChat analysis suggested multiple potential interactions of these effector CD4               +               T cells with foam cells. Finally, we integrated a published scTCR-seq dataset of the autoimmune disease psoriatic arthritis, and we report various commonalities between the two diseases. In conclusion, our data suggest that atherosclerosis has an autoimmune compondent driven by autoreactive CD4               +               T cells.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The procedure illustrated in this paper represents a new method for transcriptome analysis by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), which circumvents the need for elimination of potential DNA contamination. Compared to the existing methodologies, our method is more precise, simpler and more reproducible because it preserves the RNA's integrity, does not require materials and/or reagents that are used for elimination of DNA and it also reduces the number of samples that should be set up as negative controls. This novel procedure involves the use of a specifically modified primer during reverse transcription step, which contains mismatched bases, thus producing cDNA molecules that differ from genomic DNA. By using the same modified primer in PCR amplification, only cDNA template is amplified since genomic DNA template is partially heterologous to the primer. In this way, amplification by PCR is unaffected by any potential DNA contamination since it is specific only for the cDNA template. Furthermore, it accurately reflects the initial RNA concentration of the sample, which is prone to changes due to various physical or enzymatic treatments commonly used by the current methodologies for DNA elimination. The method is particularly suitable for quantification of highly repetitive DNA transcripts, such as satellite DNA.},

Mitochondrial dysfunction in various tissues is a prominent characteristic of age-related deterioration, but it is unclear how mitochondrial dysfunction in particular cell types contributes to this process. Desd\'in-Mic\'o               et al.               generated mice with T cells that were specifically deficient in a mitochondrial DNA--stabilizing protein. These animals exhibited multiple features associated with aging, including neurological, metabolic, muscular, and cardiovascular impairments. The defective T cells initiated an inflammatory program similar to that observed in older animals, a process called ``inflammaging.'' Blocking the cytokine tumor necrosis factor--{$\alpha$} or administering precursors of the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide restored many of these symptoms of senescence. These findings may potentially inform future therapies for age-associated diseases, as well as cachexia and cytokine-release syndrome.

Mechanisms allowing cellular coenzyme Q distribution after synthesis within mitochondria are not understood. Here we identify the cytosolic lipid transfer protein STARD7 as a critical factor of intracellular coenzyme Q transport and suppressor of ferroptosis. Dual localization of STARD7 to the intermembrane space of mitochondria and the cytosol upon cleavage by the rhomboid protease PARL ensures the synthesis of coenzyme Q in mitochondria and its transport to the plasma membrane. While mitochondrial STARD7 preserves coenzyme Q synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation function and cristae morphogenesis, cytosolic STARD7 is required for the transport of coenzyme Q to the plasma membrane and protects against ferroptosis. A coenzyme Q variant competes with phosphatidylcholine for binding to purified STARD7 in vitro. Overexpression of cytosolic STARD7 increases ferroptotic resistance of the cells, but limits coenzyme Q abundance in mitochondria and respiratory cell growth. Our findings thus demonstrate the need to coordinate coenzyme Q synthesis and cellular distribution by PARL-mediated STARD7 processing and identify PARL and STARD7 as promising targets to interfere with ferroptosis.},

  abstract = {Normal somatic cells invariably enter a state of irreversibly arrested growth and altered function after a finite number of divisions. This process, termed replicative senescence, is thought to be a tumor-suppressive mechanism and an underlying cause of aging. There is ample evidence that escape from senescence, or immortality, is important for malignant transformation. By contrast, the role of replicative senescence in organismic aging is controversial. Studies on cells cultured from donors of different ages, genetic backgrounds, or species suggest that senescence occurs in vivo and that organismic lifespan and cell replicative lifespan are under common genetic control. However, senescent cells cannot be distinguished from quiescent or terminally differentiated cells in tissues. Thus, evidence that senescent cells exist and accumulate with age in vivo is lacking. We show that several human cells express a f3-galactosidase, histochemically detectable at pH 6, upon senescence in culture. This marker was expressed by senescent, but not presenescent, fibroblasts and keratinocytes but was absent from quiescent fibroblasts and terminally differentiated keratinocytes. It was also absent from immortal cells but was induced by genetic manipulations that reversed immortality. In skin samples from human donors of different age, there was an age-dependent increase in this marker in dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes. This marker provides in situ evidence that senescent cells may exist and accumulate with age in vivo.}

Recapitulated 3D topological structures from AFM molecular surfaces reveal that all conformers share the same secondary structural elements. Only a population-weighted cohort, not any single conformer, including the crystal structure, can account for the ensemble behaviors observed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). All conformers except one are functionally active in terms of ligand binding. Our findings provide direct visual evidence that the sequence-structure relationship of RNA under physiologically relevant solution conditions is more complex than the one-to-one relationship for well-structured proteins.

In the present study, we show that enzymes that catalyze H3K9 methylation, such as Suv39h1, Suv39h2, G9a and Glp, are also retained on mitotic chromosomes. Surprisingly, however, mutants lacking histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) have unusually small and compact mitotic chromosomes associated with increased histone H3 phospho Ser10 (H3S10ph) and H3K27me3 levels. Chromosome size and centromere compaction in these mutants were rescued by providing exogenous first protein lysine methyltransferase Suv39h1 or inhibiting Ezh2 activity. Quantitative proteomic comparisons of native mitotic chromosomes isolated from wild-type versus Suv39h1/Suv39h2 double-null mouse embryonic stem cells revealed that H3K9me3 was essential for the efficient retention of bookmarking factors such as Esrrb. These results highlight an unexpected role for repressive heterochromatin domains in preserving transcription factor binding through mitosis and underscore the importance of H3K9me3 for sustaining chromosome architecture and epigenetic memory during cell division.},

Our previous observation showed that circulating levels of adrenomedullin (ADM) and mRNA and protein for ADM in omental adipose tissue were higher in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and these alterations are accompanied by glucose and lipid metabolic dysregulation, but the impact of ADM on mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration in human adipocyte remain elusive. The present study demonstrated that: (1) Increasing doses of glucose and ADM inhibit human adipocyte mRNA expressions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits of electron transport chain, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ND) 1 and 2, cytochrome (CYT) b, as well as ATPase 6; (2) ADM significantly increases human adipocyte mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation and this increase is reversed by ADM antagonist, ADM22-52, but treatment with ADM does not significantly affect mitochondrial contents in the adipocytes; (3) Adipocyte basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate are dose-dependently suppressed by ADM, thus results in impaired mitochondrial respiratory capacity. We conclude that elevated ADM observed in diabetic pregnancy may be involved in glucose and lipid dysregulation through compromising adipocyte mitochondrial function, and blockade of ADM action may improve GDM-related glucose and adipose tissue dysfunction.},

  abstract = {There is strong evidence for brain-related pathologies in COVID-19, some of which could be a consequence of viral neurotropism. The vast majority of brain imaging studies so far have focused on qualitative, gross pathology of moderate to severe cases, often carried out on hospitalised patients. It remains unknown however whether the impact of COVID-19 can be detected in milder cases, in a quantitative and automated manner, and whether this can reveal a possible mechanism for the spread of the disease. UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible to invite back in 2021 hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit. Here, we studied the effects of the disease in the brain using multimodal data from 782 participants from the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study, with 394 participants having tested positive for SARSCoV-2 infection between their two scans. We used structural and functional brain scans from before and after infection, to compare longitudinal brain changes between these 394 COVID19 patients and 388 controls who were matched for age, sex, ethnicity and interval between scans. We identified significant effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the left insula. When looking over the entire cortical surface, these results extended to the anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus and temporal pole. We further compared COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalised (n=15) with those who had not (n=379), and while results were not significant, we found comparatively similar findings to the COVID-19 vs control group comparison, with, in addition, a greater loss of grey matter in the cingulate cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and hippocampal cornu ammonis (all \textbar Z\textbar{$>$}3). Our findings thus consistently relate to loss of grey matter in limbic cortical areas directly linked to the primary olfactory and gustatory system. Unlike in post hoc disease studies, the availability of preinfection imaging data helps avoid the danger of pre-existing risk factors or clinical conditions being mis-interpreted as disease effects. Since a possible entry point of the virus to the central nervous system might be via the olfactory mucosa and the olfactory bulb, these brain imaging results might be the in vivo hallmark of the spread of the disease (or the virus itself) via olfactory and gustatory pathways.}

In recent years, numerous strategies to augment brain function have been proposed. Evidence for their efficacy (or lack thereof) and side effects has prompted discussions about ethical, societal, and medical implications. In the public debate, cognitive enhancement is often seen as a monolithic phenomenon. On a closer look, however, cognitive enhancement turns out to be a multifaceted concept: There is not one cognitive enhancer that augments brain function per se, but a great variety of interventions that can be clustered into biochemical, physical, and behavioral enhancement strategies. These cognitive enhancers differ in their mode of action, the cognitive domain they target, the time scale they work on, their availability and side effects, and how they differentially affect different groups of subjects. Here we disentangle the dimensions of cognitive enhancement, review prominent examples of cognitive enhancers that differ across these dimensions, and thereby provide a framework for both theoretical discussions and empirical research.}

Here, we show Ab oligomers bind herpesvirus surface glycoproteins, accelerating b-amyloid deposition and leading to protective viral entrapment activity in 5XFAD mouse and 3D human neural cell culture infection models against neurotropic herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) and human herpesvirus 6A and B. Herpesviridae are linked to AD, but it has been unclear how viruses may induce b-amyloidosis in brain.

  abstract = {The ability to recognize and repair abnormal DNA structures is common to all forms of life. Studies in a variety of species have identified an incredible diversity of DNA repair pathways. Documenting and characterizing the similarities and differences in repair between species has important value for understanding the origin and evolution of repair pathways as well as for improving our understanding of phenotypes affected by repair \v Ze.g., mutation rates, lifespan, tumorigenesis, survival in extreme environments.. Unfortunately, while repair processes have been studied in quite a few species, the ecological and evolutionary diversity of such studies has been limited. Complete genome sequences can provide potential sources of new information about repair in different species. In this paper, we present a global comparative analysis of DNA repair proteins and processes based upon the analysis of available complete genome sequences. We use a new form of analysis that combines genome sequence information and phylogenetic studies into a composite analysis we refer to as phylogenomics. We use this phylogenomic analysis to study the evolution of repair proteins and processes and to predict the repair phenotypes of those species for which we now know the complete genome sequence. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract           The root causes of dementia are still largely unclear, and the medical community lacks highly effective preventive and therapeutic pharmaceutical agents for dementia despite large investments into their development. There is growing interest in the question if infectious agents play a role in the development of dementia, with herpesviruses attracting particular attention. To provide causal as opposed to merely correlational evidence on this question, we take advantage of the fact that in Wales eligibility for the herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax) for shingles prevention was determined based on an individual's exact date of birth. Those born before September 2 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, while those born on or after September 2 1933 were eligible to receive the vaccine. By using country-wide data on all vaccinations received, primary and secondary care encounters, death certificates, and patients' date of birth in weeks, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01\% among patients who were merely one week too old to be eligible, to 47.2\% among those who were just one week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the herpes zoster vaccine, there is no plausible reason why those born just one week prior to September 2 1933 should differ systematically from those born one week later. We demonstrate this empirically by showing that there were no systematic differences (e.g., in pre-existing conditions or uptake of other preventive interventions) between adults across the date-of-birth eligibility cutoff, and that there were no other interventions that used the exact same date-of-birth eligibility cutoff as was used for the herpes zoster vaccine program. This unique natural randomization, thus, allows for robust causal, rather than correlational, effect estimation. We first replicate the vaccine's known effect from clinical trials of reducing the occurrence of shingles. We then show that receiving the herpes zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of seven years by 3.5 percentage points (95\% CI: 0.6 -- 7.1, p=0.019), corresponding to a 19.9\% relative reduction in the occurrence of dementia. Besides preventing shingles and dementia, the herpes zoster vaccine had no effects on any other common causes of morbidity and mortality. In exploratory analyses, we find that the protective effects from the vaccine for dementia are far stronger among women than men. Randomized trials are needed to determine the optimal population groups and time interval for administration of the herpes zoster vaccine to prevent or delay dementia, as well as to quantify the magnitude of the causal effect when more precise measures of cognition are used. Our findings strongly suggest an important role of the varicella zoster virus in the etiology of dementia.},

  abstract = {Aging (senescence) is characterized by the development of numerous pathologies, some of which limit lifespan. Key to understanding aging is discovery of the mechanisms (etiologies) that cause senescent pathology. In C. elegans, a major senescent pathology of unknown etiology is atrophy of its principal metabolic organ, the intestine. Here we identify a cause of not only this pathology but also of yolky lipid accumulation and redistribution (a form of senescent obesity): autophagy-mediated conversion of intestinal biomass into yolk. Inhibiting intestinal autophagy or vitellogenesis rescues both visceral pathologies and can also extend lifespan. This defines a disease syndrome leading to multimorbidity and contributing to late-life mortality. Activation of gut-to-yolk biomass conversion by insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) promotes reproduction and senescence. This illustrates how major, IIS-promoted senescent pathologies in C. elegans can originate not from damage accumulation but from direct effects of futile, continued action of a wild-type biological program (vitellogenesis).}

Here, we use four such age estimators to show that epigenetic aging can be reversed in humans. Using a protocol intended to regenerate the thymus, we observed protective immunological changes, improved risk indices for many age-related diseases, and a mean epigenetic age approximately 1.5 years less than baseline after 1 year of treatment (-2.5-year change compared to no treatment at the end of the study). The rate of epigenetic aging reversal relative to chronological age accelerated from -1.6 year/year from 0-- 9 month to -6.5 year/year from 9-- 12 month. The GrimAge predictor of human morbidity and mortality showed a 2-year decrease in epigenetic vs. chronological age that persisted six months after discontinuing treatment. This is to our knowledge the first report of an increase, based on an epigenetic age estimator, in predicted human lifespan by means of a currently accessible aging intervention.}

  abstract = {Analogous to sequence alignment, network alignment (NA) can be used to transfer biological knowledge across species between conserved network regions. NA faces two algorithmic challenges: 1) Which cost function to use to capture ``similarities'' between nodes in different networks? 2) Which alignment strategy to use to rapidly identify ``high-scoring'' alignments from all possible alignments? We ``break down'' existing state-of-the-art methods that use both different cost functions and different alignment strategies to evaluate each combination of their cost functions and alignment strategies. We find that a combination of the cost function of one method and the alignment strategy of another method beats the existing methods. Hence, we propose this combination as a novel superior NA method. Then, since human aging is hard to study experimentally due to long lifespan, we use NA to transfer aging-related knowledge from well annotated model species to poorly annotated human. By doing so, we produce novel human aging-related knowledge, which complements currently available knowledge about aging that has been obtained mainly by sequence alignment. We demonstrate significant similarity between topological and functional properties of our novel predictions and those of known aging-related genes. We are the first to use NA to learn more about aging.}

Both in the low-noise phase and in the high-noise phase, probabilistic model selection leads to optimal generalization to unseen data. This is in contrast to standard machine learning approaches, including artificial neural networks, which in this particular problem are limited, in the low-noise phase, by their ability to interpolate. In the transition region between the learnable and unlearnable phases, generalization is hard for all approaches including probabilistic model selection.},

Here, we present a cell-impermeable small-molecule fluorophore, termed Rhobo6, that turns on and red shifts upon reversible binding to glycans. Given that most ECM components are densely glycosylated, the dye enables wash-free visualization of ECM, in systems ranging from in vitro substrates to in vivo mouse mammary tumors. Relative to existing techniques, Rhobo6 provides a broad substrate profile, superior tissue penetration, non-perturbative labeling, and negligible photobleaching. This work establishes a straightforward method for imaging the distribution of ECM in live tissues and organisms, lowering barriers for investigation of extracellular biology.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        At over 200 years, the maximum lifespan of the bowhead whale exceeds that of all other mammals. The bowhead is also the second-largest animal on Earth, reaching over 80,000 kg             1             . In spite of its very large number of cells, the bowhead is not highly cancer-prone, an incongruity termed Peto's Paradox             2             . This has been explained by the evolution of additional tumor suppressor genes in larger animals, which is supported by research on elephants demonstrating expansion of the p53 gene             3--5             . However, we show here that bowhead whale fibroblasts undergo oncogenic transformation after disruption of fewer tumor suppressors than required for human fibroblasts. Instead, analysis of DNA repair revealed that bowhead cells repair double-strand breaks with uniquely high efficiency and accuracy compared to other mammals. Further, we identified two proteins, CIRBP and RPA2, that are present at high levels in bowhead fibroblasts and increase the efficiency and fidelity of DNA repair in human cells. These results suggest that rather than possessing additional tumor suppressor genes as barriers to oncogenesis, the bowhead whale relies on more accurate and efficient DNA repair to preserve genome integrity. This strategy that does not eliminate cells but repairs them, may be critical for the long and cancer-free lifespan of the bowhead whale. Our work demonstrates the value of studying long-lived organisms in identifying novel longevity mechanisms and their potential for translation to humans.},

  abstract = {The ability of the nervous system to sense cellular stress and coordinate protein homeostasis is essential for organismal health. Unfortunately, stress responses that mitigate disturbances in proteostasis, such as the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR ER ), become defunct with age. In this work, we expressed the constitutively active UPR ER transcription factor, XBP-1s, in a subset of astrocyte-like glia, which extended the life span in Caenorhabditis elegans . Glial XBP-1s initiated a robust cell nonautonomous activation of the UPR ER in distal cells and rendered animals more resistant to protein aggregation and chronic ER stress. Mutants deficient in neuropeptide processing and secretion suppressed glial cell nonautonomous induction of the UPR ER and life-span extension. Thus, astrocyte-like glial cells play a role in regulating organismal ER stress resistance and longevity.}

  abstract = {Given the central role of DNA in life, and how ageing can be seen as the gradual and irreversible breakdown of living systems, the idea that damage to the DNA is the crucial cause of ageing remains a powerful one. DNA damage and mutations of different types clearly accumulate with age in mammalian tissues. Human progeroid syndromes resulting in what appears to be accelerated ageing have been linked to defects in DNA repair or processing, suggesting that elevated levels of DNA damage can accelerate physiological decline and the development of age-related diseases not limited to cancer. Higher DNA damage may trigger cellular signalling pathways, such as apoptosis, that result in a faster depletion of stem cells, which in turn contributes to accelerated ageing. Genetic manipulations of DNA repair pathways in mice further strengthen this view and also indicate that disruption of specific pathways, such as nucleotide excision repair and non-homologous end joining, is more strongly associated with premature ageing phenotypes. Delaying ageing in mice by decreasing levels of DNA damage, however, has not been achieved yet, perhaps due to the complexity inherent to DNA repair and DNA damage response pathways. Another open question is whether DNA repair optimization is involved in the evolution of species longevity, and we suggest that the way cells from different organisms respond to DNA damage may be crucial in species differences in ageing. Taken together, the data suggest a major role of DNA damage in the modulation of longevity, possibly through effects on cell dysfunction and loss, although understanding how to modify DNA damage repair and response systems to delay ageing remains a crucial challenge.}

Currently, quantum variational circuits are one of the main strategies used to build such models. However, despite its widespread use, we still do not know what are the minimum resources needed to create a quantum machine learning model. In this article, we analyze how the expressiveness of the parametrization affects the cost function. We analytically show that the more expressive the parametrization is, the more the cost function will tend to concentrate around a value that depends both on the chosen observable and on the number of qubits used. For this, we initially obtain a relationship between the expressiveness of the parametrization and the mean value of the cost function. Afterwards, we relate the expressivity of the parametrization with the variance of the cost function. Finally, we show some numerical simulation results that confirm our theoretical-analytical predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these two important aspects of quantum neural networks are explicitly connected.},

Hence, ameliorating the effects of ageing may prevent multiple diseases simultaneously. Drugs licensed for human use against specific diseases have proved to be effective in extending lifespan and healthspan in animal models, suggesting that there is scope for drug repurposing in humans. New bioinformatic methods to identify and prioritise potential anti-ageing compounds for humans are therefore of interest. In this study, we first used drug-protein interaction information, to rank 1,147 drugs by their likelihood of targeting ageing-related gene products in humans. Among 19 statistically significant drugs, 6 have already been shown to have pro-longevity properties in animal models (p {$<$} 0.001). Using the targets of each drug, we established their association with ageing at multiple levels of biological action including pathways, functions and protein interactions. Finally, combining all the data, we calculated a ranked list of drugs that identified tanespimycin, an inhibitor of HSP-90, as the top-ranked novel anti-ageing candidate. We experimentally validated the pro-longevity effect of tanespimycin through its HSP-90 target in Caenorhabditis elegans.}

Most DNA sequencing approaches address either genetics or epigenetics and thus capture incomplete information. Methods widely used to detect epigenetic DNA bases fail to capture common C-to-T mutations or distinguish 5-methylcytosine from 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. We present a single base-resolution sequencing methodology that sequences complete genetics and the two most common cytosine modifications in a single workflow. DNA is copied and bases are enzymatically converted. Coupled decoding of bases across the original and copy strand provides a phased digital readout. Methods are demonstrated on human genomic DNA and cell-free DNA from a blood sample of a patient with cancer. The approach is accurate, requires low DNA input and has a simple workflow and analysis pipeline. Simultaneous, phased reading of genetic and epigenetic bases provides a more complete picture of the information stored in genomes and has applications throughout biomedicine.},

However, it is unclear if connections between integrins and the ECM are immediately capable of transducing cytoskeletal contraction into migration force, or whether engagement of force transmission requires maturation of the adhesion. Here, we show that initial integrin--ECM adhesions become capable of exerting migration force with the recruitment of vinculin, a marker for focal complexes, which are precursors of focal adhesions. We are able to induce the development of focal complexes by the application of mechanical force to fibronectin receptors from inside or outside the cell, and we are able to extend focal complex formation to vitronectin receptors by the removal of c-Src. These results indicate that cells use mechanical force as a signal to strengthen initial integrin--ECM adhesions into focal complexes and regulate the amount of migration force applied to individual adhesions at localized regions of the advancing lamella.},

It governs the synthesis, translocation, membrane insertion,               N               -glycosylation, folding and disulfide-bond formation of nascent proteins. Although individual components of this machinery have been studied at high resolution in isolation               3--7               , insights into their interplay in the native membrane remain limited. Here we use cryo-electron tomography, extensive classification and molecular modelling to capture snapshots of mRNA translation and protein maturation at the ER membrane at molecular resolution. We identify a highly abundant classical pre-translocation intermediate with eukaryotic elongation factor 1a (eEF1a) in an extended conformation, suggesting that eEF1a may remain associated with the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis during proofreading. At the ER membrane, distinct polysomes bind to different ER translocons specialized in the synthesis of proteins with signal peptides or multipass transmembrane proteins with the translocon-associated protein complex (TRAP) present in both. The near-complete atomic model of the most abundant ER translocon variant comprising the protein-conducting channel SEC61, TRAP and the oligosaccharyltransferase complex A (OSTA) reveals specific interactions of TRAP with other translocon components. We observe stoichiometric and sub-stoichiometric cofactors associated with OSTA, which are likely to include protein isomerases. In sum, we visualize ER-bound polysomes with their coordinated downstream machinery.},

The challenge has evolved from generating sequence information to mining the databases to integrating and leveraging the available information, i.e., the availability of ``genomic enzymology'' web tools. Web tools that allow identification of biosynthetic gene clusters are widely used by the natural products/synthetic biology community, thereby facilitating the discovery of novel natural products and the enzymes responsible for their biosynthesis. However, many novel enzymes with interesting mechanisms participate in uncharacterized small-molecule metabolic pathways; their discovery and functional characterization also can be accomplished by leveraging information in protein and nucleic acid databases. This Perspective focuses on two genomic enzymology web tools that assist the discovery novel metabolic pathways: (1) Enzyme Function Initiative-Enzyme Similarity Tool (EFI-EST) for generating sequence similarity networks to visualize and analyze sequence-function space in protein families and (2) Enzyme Function Initiative-Genome Neighborhood Tool (EFI-GNT) for generating genome neighborhood networks to visualize and analyze the genome context in microbial and fungal genomes. Both tools have been adapted to other applications to facilitate target selection for enzyme discovery and functional characterization. As the natural products community has demonstrated, the enzymology community needs to embrace the essential role of web tools that allow the protein and genome sequence databases to be leveraged for novel insights into enzymological problems.}

  abstract = {Ageing is the gradual decline in organismal fitness that occurs over time leading to tissue dysfunction and disease. At the cellular level, ageing is associated with reduced function, altered gene expression and a perturbed epigenome. Somatic cell reprogramming, the process of converting somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), can reverse these age-associated changes. However, during iPSC reprogramming, somatic cell identity is lost, and can be difficult to reacquire as re-differentiated iPSCs often resemble foetal rather than mature adult cells. Recent work has demonstrated that the epigenome is already rejuvenated by the maturation phase of reprogramming, which suggests full iPSC reprogramming is not required to reverse ageing of somatic cells. Here we have developed the first 'maturation phase transient reprogramming' (MPTR) method, where reprogramming factors are expressed until this rejuvenation point followed by withdrawal of their induction. Using dermal fibroblasts from middle age donors, we found that cells temporarily lose and then reacquire their fibroblast identity during MPTR, possibly as a result of epigenetic memory at enhancers and/or persistent expression of some fibroblast genes. Excitingly, our method substantially rejuvenated multiple cellular attributes including the transcriptome, which was rejuvenated by around 30 years as measured by a novel transcriptome clock. The epigenome, including H3K9me3 histone methylation levels and the DNA methylation ageing clock, was rejuvenated to a similar extent. The magnitude of rejuvenation instigated by MTPR appears substantially greater than that achieved in previous transient reprogramming protocols. In addition, MPTR fibroblasts produced youthful levels of collagen proteins, and showed partial functional rejuvenation of their migration speed. Finally, our work suggests that more extensive reprogramming does not necessarily result in greater rejuvenation but instead that optimal time windows exist for rejuvenating the transcriptome and the epigenome. Overall, we demonstrate that it is possible to separate rejuvenation from complete pluripotency reprogramming, which should facilitate the discovery of novel anti-ageing genes and therapies.},

The tracing of the absorbed power relies on comparing the response of the bolometer between radio frequency and dc-heating powers traced to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall resistance. To illustrate this technique, we demonstrate two different methods of dc-substitution to calibrate the power that is delivered to the base temperature stage of a dilution refrigerator using our in situ power sensor. As an example, we demonstrate the ability to accurately measure the attenuation of a coaxial input line between the frequencies of 50 MHz and 7 GHz with an uncertainty down to 0.1 dB at a typical input power of -114 dBm.},

  abstract = {Different theories posit that aging is caused by molecular damage, genetic programs, continued development, hyperfunction, antagonistic pleiotropy alleles, mutations, trade-offs, incomplete repair, etc. Here, I discuss that these ideas can be conceptually unified as they capture particular facets of aging, while being incomplete. Their respective deleterious effects impact fitness at different levels of biological organization, adjusting progression through aging, rather than causing it. Living is associated with a myriad of deleterious processes, both random and deterministic, which are caused by imperfectness, exhibit cumulative properties, and represent the indirect effects of biological functions at all levels, from simple molecules to systems. From this, I derive the deleteriome, which encompasses cumulative deleterious agerelated changes and represents the biological age. The organismal deleteriome consists of the deleteriomes of cells, organs, and systems, which change along roughly synchronized trajectories and may be assessed through biomarkers of aging. Aging is then a progressive decline in fitness due to the increasing deleteriome, adjusted by genetic, environmental, and stochastic processes. This model allows integration of diverse aging concepts, provides insights into the nature of aging, and suggests how lifespan may be adjusted during evolution and in experimental models.}

This inherent imperfectness leads to the generation of damage by every biological process, at all levels, from small molecules to cells. The damage is too numerous to be repaired, is partially invisible to natural selection and manifests as aging. I propose that it is the inherent imperfectness of biological systems that is the true root of the aging process. As each biomolecule generates specific forms of damage, the cumulative damage is largely non-random and is indirectly encoded in the genome. I consider this concept in light of other proposed theories of aging and integrate these disparate ideas into a single model. I also discuss the evolutionary significance of damage accumulation and strategies for reducing damage. Finally, I suggest ways to test this integrated model of aging.}

  abstract = {Morphology and function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and corresponding working memory performance, are affected early in the aging process, but nearly half of aged individuals are spared of working memory deficits. Translationally relevant model systems are critical for determining the neurobiological drivers of this variability. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is advantageous as a model for these investigations because, as a non-human primate, marmosets have a clearly defined dlPFC that enables measurement of prefrontal-dependent cognitive functions, and their short ({$\sim$}10 year) lifespan facilitates longitudinal studies of aging. Previously, we characterized working memory capacity in a cohort of marmosets that collectively covered the lifespan, and found age-related working memory impairment. We also found a remarkable degree of heterogeneity in performance, similar to that found in humans. Here, we tested the hypothesis that changes to synaptic ultrastructure that affect synaptic efficacy stratify marmosets that age with cognitive impairment from those that age without cognitive impairment. We utilized electron microscopy to visualize synapses in the marmoset dlPFC and measured the sizes of boutons, presynaptic mitochondria, and synapses. We found that coordinated scaling of the sizes of synapses and mitochondria with their associated boutons is essential for intact working memory performance in aged marmosets. Further, lack of synaptic scaling, due to a remarkable failure of synaptic mitochondria to scale with presynaptic boutons, selectively underlies age-related working memory impairment. We posit that this decoupling results in mismatched energy supply and demand, leading to impaired synaptic transmission. We also found that aged marmosets have fewer synapses in dlPFC than young, though the severity of synapse loss did not predict whether aging occurred with or without cognitive impairment. This work identifies a novel mechanism of synapse dysfunction that stratifies marmosets that age with cognitive impairment from those that age without cognitive impairment. The process by which synaptic scaling is regulated is yet unknown and warrants future investigation.},

There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinitypurification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 67 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.}

An open question, however, is the degree to which inherited variation in or near genes encoding each organelle contributes to age-related disease pathogenesis. Here, we evaluate if genetic loci encoding organelle proteomes confer greater-than-expected age-related disease risk. As mitochondrial dysfunction is a `hallmark' of aging, we begin by assessing nuclear and mitochondrial DNA loci near genes encoding the mitochondrial proteome and surprisingly observe a lack of enrichment across 24 age-related traits. Within nine other organelles, we find no enrichment with one exception: the nucleus, where enrichment emanates from nuclear transcription factors. In agreement, we find that genes encoding several organelles tend to be `haplosufficient,' while we observe strong purifying selection against heterozygous protein-truncating variants impacting the nucleus. Our work identifies common variation near transcription factors as having outsize influence on age-related trait risk, motivating future efforts to determine if and how this inherited variation then contributes to observed age-related organelle deterioration.}

Our laboratory recently showed that MSC originating from older donors suffer from limited proliferative capacity and significantly reduced myogenic differentiation potential. This is a major concern, as the patients most likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease are elderly. Here we tested the hypothesis that a single pluripotency associated transcription factor, namely Nanog, may reverse the proliferation and differentiation potential of BM-MSC from adult donors. Microarray analysis showed that adult (a)BM-MSC expressing Nanog clustered close to Nanog-expressing neonatal cells. Nanog markedly upregulated genes involved in cell cycle, DNA replication and DNA damage repair and enhanced the proliferation rate and clonogenic capacity of aBM-MSC. Notably, Nanog reversed the myogenic differentiation potential and restored the contractile function of aBM-MSC to a similar level as that of neonatal (n)BM-MSC. The effect of Nanog on contractility was mediated -- at least in part - through activation of the TGF-{$\beta$} pathway by diffusible factors secreted in the conditioned medium of Nanog-expressing BM-MSC. Overall, our results suggest that Nanog may be used to overcome the effects of organismal aging on aBMMSC, thereby increasing the potential of MSC from aged donors for cellular therapy and tissue regeneration.}

Measurements are repeated over the course of hours, and presented alongside novel analysis to quantify changes in the cells' low-frequency elastic modulus and the cell's dynamics over the time window from around 0.01s to 10s. An analogy to optical trapping allows verification of the invariant viscosity of HeLa S3 cells under control conditions and after cytoskeletal disruption. Stiffening of the cell is observed during cytoskeletal rearrangement in the control case, and cell softening when the actin cytoskeleton is disrupted by Latrunculin B. These data correlate with conventional understanding that integrin binding and recruitment triggers cytoskeletal rearrangement. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that cell stiffening has been measured during focal adhesion maturation, and the longest time over which such stiffening has been quantified by any means.},

In this paper we compare two complementary approaches for describing GRN dynamics across unknown parameters: (1) parameter sampling and resulting ensemble statistics used by RACIPE (RAndom CIrcuit PErturbation), and (2) use of rigorous analysis of combinatorial approximation of the ODE models by DSGRN (Dynamic Signatures Generated by Regulatory Networks). We find a very good agreement between RACIPE simulation and DSGRN predictions for four different 2- and 3-node networks typically observed in cellular decision making. This observation is remarkable since the DSGRN approach assumes that the Hill coefficients of the models are very high while RACIPE assumes the values in the range 1-6. Thus DSGRN parameter domains, explicitly defined by inequalities between systems parameters, are highly predictive of ODE model dynamics within a biologically reasonable range of parameters.},

We tested associations between probe expression intensity and advancing age (adjusting for confounding factors), initially in a discovery set (n = 458), following-up findings in a replication set (n = 240). We confirmed expression of key results by real-time PCR. Of 16 571 expressed probes, only 295 (2\%) were robustly associated with age. Just six probes were required for a highly efficient model for distinguishing between young and old (area under the curve in replication set; 95\%). The focused nature of age-related gene expression may therefore provide potential biomarkers of aging. Similarly, only 7 of 1065 biological or metabolic pathways were age-associated, in gene set enrichment analysis, notably including the processing of messenger RNAs (mRNAs); [P {$<$} 0.002, false discovery rate (FDR) q {$<$} 0.05].

We also demonstrate that the viral mimic poly(I:C) is sufficient to expose genetic susceptibility to hair graying.

  abstract = {Background: A new paradigm of biological investigation takes advantage of technologies that produce large high throughput datasets, including genome sequences, interactions of proteins, and gene expression. The ability of biologists to analyze and interpret such data relies on functional annotation of the included proteins, but even in highly characterized organisms many proteins can lack the functional evidence necessary to infer their biological relevance. Results: Here we have applied high confidence function predictions from our automated prediction system, PFP, to three genome sequences, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria). The number of annotated genes is increased by PFP to over 90\% for all of the genomes. Using the large coverage of the function annotation, we introduced the functional similarity networks which represent the functional space of the proteomes. Four different functional similarity networks are constructed for each proteome, one each by considering similarity in a single Gene Ontology (GO) category, i.e. Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function, and another one by considering overall similarity with the funSim score. The functional similarity networks are shown to have higher modularity than the protein-protein interaction network. Moreover, the funSim score network is distinct from the single GO-score networks by showing a higher clustering degree exponent value and thus has a higher tendency to be hierarchical. In addition, examining function assignments to the protein-protein interaction network and local regions of genomes has identified numerous cases where subnetworks or local regions have functionally coherent proteins. These results will help interpreting interactions of proteins and gene orders in a genome. Several examples of both analyses are highlighted. Conclusion: The analyses demonstrate that applying high confidence predictions from PFP can have a significant impact on a researchers' ability to interpret the immense biological data that are being generated today. The newly introduced functional similarity networks of the three organisms show different network properties as compared with the protein-protein interaction networks.}

In budding yeast, aging is associated with a loss of epigenetic information that occurs in response to genome instability, particularly DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Mammals also undergo predictable epigenetic changes with age, including alterations to DNA methylation patterns that serve as epigenetic "age" clocks, but what drives these changes is not known. Using a transgenic mouse system called "ICE" (for inducible changes to the epigenome), we show that a tissue's response to non-mutagenic DSBs reorganizes the epigenome and accelerates physiological, cognitive, and molecular changes normally seen in older mice, including advancement of the epigenetic clock. These findings implicate DSB-induced epigenetic drift as a conserved cause of aging from yeast to mammals.}

However, its full potential for precision medicine has yet to be reached. Towards this, we propose A Single-cell Guided Pipeline to Aid Repurposing of Drugs (ASGARD) that defines a drug score to recommend drugs by considering all cell clusters to address the intercellular heterogeneity within each patient. ASGARD shows significantly better average accuracy on single-drug therapy compared to two bulk-cell-based drug repurposing methods. We also demonstrated that it performs considerably better than other cell cluster-level predicting methods. In addition, we validate ASGARD using the drug response prediction method TRANSACT with Triple-Negative-Breast-Cancer patient samples. We find that many top-ranked drugs are either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or in clinical trials treating corresponding diseases. In conclusion, ASGARD is a promising drug repurposing recommendation tool guided by single-cell RNA-seq for personalized medicine.

Using neural networks, we predict senescence from the nuclear morphology of human fibroblasts with up to 95\% accuracy, and investigate murine astrocytes, murine neurons, and fibroblasts with premature aging in culture. After generalizing our approach, the predictor recognizes higher rates of senescence in p21-positive and ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU)-negative nuclei in tissues and shows an increasing rate of senescent cells with age in H\&E-stained murine liver tissue and human dermal biopsies. Evaluating medical records reveals that higher rates of senescent cells correspond to decreased rates of malignant neoplasms and increased rates of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, hypertension and cerebral infarction. In sum, we show that morphological alterations of the nucleus can serve as a deep learning predictor of senescence that is applicable across tissues and species and is associated with health outcomes in humans.}

A limitation in yeast lifespan studies has been the difficulty of separating old cells from young cells in large quantities. We engineered a new platform, the Miniature-chemostat Aging Device (MAD), that enables purification of aged cells at sufficient quantities for genomic and biochemical characterization of aging yeast populations. Using MAD, we measured DNA accessibility and gene expression changes in aging cells. Our data highlight an intimate connection between aging, growth rate, and stress. Stress-independent genes that change with age are highly enriched for targets of the signal recognition particle (SRP). Combining MAD with an improved ATAC-seq method, we find that increasing proteasome activity reduces rDNA instability usually observed in aging cells and, contrary to published findings, provide evidence that global nucleosome occupancy does not change significantly with age.}

In skeletal muscle, deletion mutations clonally accumulate along the length of individual fibers. At high intrafiber abundances, these mutations disrupt individual cell respiration and are linked to the activation of apoptosis, intrafiber atrophy, breakage, and necrosis, contributing to fiber loss. This sequence of molecular and cellular events suggests a putative mechanism for the permanent loss of muscle fibers with age. To test whether mtDNA deletion mutation accumulation is a significant contributor to the fiber loss observed in aging muscle, we pharmacologically induced deletion mutation accumulation. We observed a 1200\% increase in mtDNA deletion mutation-containing electron transport chaindeficient muscle fibers, an 18\% decrease in muscle fiber number and 22\% worsening of muscle mass loss. These data affirm the hypothesized role for mtDNA deletion mutation in the etiology of muscle fiber loss at old age.}

Concerningly, some experiments in model organisms have suggested that metformin use at old ages shortens life span and is toxic to mitochondria. The demonstrated safety of metformin therapy in humans and the conflicting data from model organisms compelled us to test the hypothesis that metformin treatment would be toxic to older rats. To define an effective dose in 30-month-old hybrid rats, we evaluated two doses of metformin (0.1\%, 0.75\% of the diet) and treated the rats for 4 months. Body mass decreased at the 0.75\% dose. Neither dose affected mortality between 30 and 34 months of age. We assessed mitochondrial integrity by measuring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and deletion mutation frequency, and mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle and the heart. In skeletal muscle, we observed no effect of metformin on quadriceps mass, mtDNA copy number, or deletion frequency. In the heart, metformin-treated rats had higher mtDNA copy number, lower cardiac mass, with no change in mtDNA deletion frequency. Metformin treatment resulted in lower mitochondrial complex I-dependent respiration in the heart. We found that, in old rats, metformin did not compromise mtDNA integrity, did not affect mortality, and may have cardiac benefits. These data provide some reassurance that a metformin intervention in aged mammals is not toxic at appropriate doses.}

Correctly annotating the functions of highly diverse proteins can be difficult, however, hindering use of this information. Global analysis of large superfamilies of related proteins is a powerful strategy for understanding the evolution of reactions by identifying catalytic commonalities and differences in reaction and substrate specificity, even when only a few members have been biochemically or structurally characterized. A comparison of {$>$}2500 sequences sharing the six-bladed b-propeller fold establishes sequence, structural, and functional links among the three subgroups of the functionally diverse N6P superfamily: the arylesterase-like and senescence marker protein-30/gluconolactonase/luciferin-regenerating enzymelike (SGL) subgroups, representing enzymes that catalyze lactonase and related hydrolytic reactions, and the so-called strictosidine synthase-like (SSL) subgroup. Metal-coordinating residues were identified as broadly conserved in the active sites of all three subgroups except for a few proteins from the SSL subgroup, which have been experimentally determined to catalyze the quite different strictosidine synthase (SS) reaction, a metal-independent condensation reaction. Despite these differences, comparison of conserved catalytic features of the arylesterase-like and SGL enzymes with the SSs identified similar structural and mechanistic attributes between the hydrolytic reactions catalyzed by the former and the condensation reaction catalyzed by SS. The results also suggest that despite their annotations, the great majority of these {$>$}500 SSL sequences do not catalyze the SS reaction; rather, they likely catalyze hydrolytic reactions typical of the other two subgroups instead. This prediction was confirmed experimentally for one of these proteins.}

We previously reported a proline-to-arginine mutation in DEC2 that leads to a life-long decrease in daily sleep need. We found that the expression of an important sleep-relevant gene, orexin , was increased in the DEC2 mutant mice. Further investigation revealed that DEC2 is a transcriptional repressor for orexin expression, and that mutant DEC2 exerts less repressor activity than WT-DEC2, resulting in increased orexin expression. This study represents the first step toward understanding the underlying molecular mechanism through which DEC2 modulates sleep. , Adequate sleep is essential for physical and mental health. We previously identified a missense mutation in the human DEC2 gene ( BHLHE41 ) leading to the familial natural short sleep behavioral trait. DEC2 is a transcription factor regulating the circadian clock in mammals, although its role in sleep regulation has been unclear. Here we report that prepro-orexin , also known as hypocretin ( Hcrt ), gene expression is increased in the mouse model expressing the mutant h DEC2 transgene (h DEC2-P384R ). Prepro-orexin encodes a precursor protein of a neuropeptide producing orexin A and B (hcrt1 and hcrt2), which is enriched in the hypothalamus and regulates maintenance of arousal. In cell culture, DEC2 suppressed prepro-orexin promoter-luc ( ore-luc ) expression through cis -acting E-box elements. The mutant DEC2 has less repressor activity than WT-DEC2, resulting in increased orexin expression. DEC2-binding affinity for the prepro-orexin gene promoter is decreased by the P384R mutation, likely due to weakened interaction with other transcription factors. In vivo, the decreased immobility time of the mutant transgenic mice is attenuated by an orexin receptor antagonist. Our results suggested that DEC2 regulates sleep/wake duration, at least in part, by modulating the neuropeptide hormone orexin.}

However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient ``turnkey'' sampling algorithms.},

  abstract = {Background: The capacity of a polyphenol-enriched diet to modulate the epigenome in vivo is partly unknown. Given the beneficial metabolic effects of a Mediterranean (MED) diet enriched in polyphenols and reduced in red/processed meat (green-MED), as previously been proven by the 18-month DIRECT PLUS randomized controlled trial, we analyzed the effects of the green-MED diet on methylome and transcriptome levels to highlight molecular mechanisms underlying the observed metabolic improvements. Methods: Our study included 260 participants (baseline BMI = 31.2 kg/m2, age = 5 years) of the DIRECT PLUS trial, initially randomized to one of the intervention arms: A. healthy dietary guidelines (HDG), B. MED (440 mg polyphenols additionally provided by walnuts), C. greenMED (1240 mg polyphenols additionally provided by walnuts, green tea, and Mankai: green duckweed shake). Blood methylome and transcriptome of all study subjects were analyzed at baseline and after completing the 18-month intervention using Illumina EPIC and RNA sequencing technologies. Results: A total of 1,573 differentially methylated regions (DMRs; false discovery rate (FDR) {$<$} 5\%) were found in the green-MED compared to the MED (177) and HDG (377) diet participants. This corresponded to 1,753 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; FDR {$<$} 5\%) in the green-MED intervention compared to MED (7) and HDG (738). Consistently, the highest number (6\%) of epigenetic modulating genes was transcriptionally changed in subjects participating in the greenMED intervention. Weighted cluster network analysis relating transcriptional and phenotype changes among participants subjected to the green-MED intervention identified candidate genes associated with serum-folic acid change (all P {$<$} 1x10-3) and highlighted one module including the KIR3DS1 locus, being negatively associated with the polyphenol changes (e.g. P {$<$} 1x10-4), but positively associated with the MRI-assessed superficial subcutaneous adipose area-, weight- and waist circumference- 18-month change (all P {$<$} 0.05). Amongst others, this module included the DMR gene Cystathionine Beta-Synthase, playing a major role in homocysteine reduction. Conclusions: The green-MED high polyphenol diet, rich in green tea and Mankai, renders a high capacity to regulate an individual's epigenome. Our findings suggest epigenetic key drivers such as folate and green diet marker to mediate this capacity and indicate a direct effect of dietary polyphenols on the one-carbon metabolism.},

Here we utilize a recent biomarker of aging (referred to as epigenetic clock) to assess the epigenetic ages of up to 30 anatomic sites from supercentenarians (subjects who reached an age of 110 or older) and younger subjects. Using three novel and three published human DNA methylation data sets, we demonstrate that the cerebellum ages more slowly than other parts of the human body. We used both transcriptional data and genetic data to elucidate molecular mechanisms which may explain this finding. The two largest superfamilies of helicases (SF1 and SF2) are significantly over-represented (p=9.2x10-9) among gene transcripts that are over-expressed in the cerebellum compared to other brain regions from the same subject. Furthermore, SNPs that are associated with epigenetic age acceleration in the cerebellum tend to be located near genes from helicase superfamilies SF1 and SF2 (enrichment p=5.8x10-3). Our genetic and transcriptional studies of epigenetic age acceleration support the hypothesis that the slow aging rate of the cerebellum is due to processes that involve RNA helicases.}

Results: I developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types. The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance. Conclusions: I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock can be used to address a host of questions in developmental biology, cancer and aging research.}

  abstract = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging, and underlies the development of many diseases. Cells maintain mitochondrial homeostasis through a number of pathways that remodel the mitochondrial proteome or alter mitochondrial content during times of stress or metabolic adaptation. Here, using yeast as a model system, we identify a new mitochondrial degradation system that remodels the mitochondrial proteome of aged cells. Unlike many common mitochondrial degradation pathways, this system selectively removes a subset of membrane proteins from the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes, while leaving the remainder of the organelle intact. Selective removal of preexisting proteins is achieved by sorting into a mitochondrial-derived compartment, or MDC, followed by release through mitochondrial fission and elimination by autophagy. Formation of MDCs requires the import receptors Tom70/71, and failure to form these structures exacerbates preexisting mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that the MDC pathway provides protection to mitochondria in times of stress. , Our cells contain compartments called mitochondria, which provide energy and serve as a home for many metabolic pathways that are critical for life. Changes in mitochondrial activity can contribute to aging and to the development of several age-associated diseases. However, our cells contain systems that detect changes in the performance of mitochondria and can act to re-establish a healthy state. These systems respond to stress or changes in metabolism by degrading particular proteins in the mitochondria. This enables damaged or unwanted proteins to be replaced with new proteins, but it is not clear how these mitochondrial defense systems work to keep mitochondria healthy as an organism ages. Budding yeast is a good model in which to study the aging process because the performance of this yeast's mitochondria change in a characteristic way as the yeast ages. Previous studies have shown that these changes are caused by alterations in another cell structure called the lysosome, which can store nutrients and is where many proteins are degraded. Here, Hughes et al. used yeast cells to investigate how mitochondrial defense systems operate during aging. The experiments reveal an entirely new mitochondrial protein degradation system that helps to keep the mitochondria healthy as the yeast cells age. This process is rapidly triggered by changes in lysosome activity and results in certain proteins in each mitochondrion being sorted into a small compartment made from a part of the mitochondrion. This compartment is released from the mitochondrion and then travels to the lysosome where the proteins are destroyed. Inhibiting the formation of these compartments results in mitochondria being more sensitive to cellular stress. The next steps following on from this work are to find out exactly what role this mitochondrial defense pathway plays in cells and why it targets only a small set of all the proteins found in mitochondria.}

Here, we surveyed the elevated stiffness of Ab-plaque-associated tissues and observed the selective upregulation of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in Ab-plaque-associated microglia. Piezo1 sensed the stiffness stimuli of Ab fibrils and subsequently induced Ca2+ influx for microglial clustering, phagocytosis, and compacting of Ab plaques. Microglia lacking Piezo1 led to the exacerbation of Ab pathology and cognitive decline, whereas pharmacological activation of microglial Piezo1 ameliorated brain Ab burden and cognitive impairment in 5 3 FAD mice.

The transmembrane protein PLA2R1 (phospholipase A2 receptor) promotes cellular senescence, which can inhibit oncogene-induced tumor initiation. Functions and mechanisms of action of PLA2R1 during aging are largely unknown. In this study, we observed that old Pla2r1 knockout mice were more prone to spontaneously develop a wide spectrum of tumors compared to control littermates. Consistently, these knockout mice displayed increased Parp1, a master regulator of DNA damage repair, and decreased DNA damage, correlating with large human dataset analysis. Forced PLA2R1 expression in normal human cells decreased PARP1 expression, induced DNA damage and subsequent senescence, while the constitutive expression of PARP1 rescued cells from these PLA2R1-induced effects. Mechanistically, PARP1 expression is repressed by a ROS (reactive oxygen species)-Rb-dependent mechanism upon PLA2R1 expression. In conclusion, our results suggest that PLA2R1 suppresses aging-induced tumors by repressing PARP1, via a ROS-- Rb signaling axis, and inducing DNA damage and its tumor suppressive responses.}

  abstract = {Calorie restriction (CR) remains the most robust environmental intervention for altering aging processes and increasing healthspan and lifespan. Emerging from progress made in many nonhuman models, current research has expanded to formal, controlled human studies of CR. Since long-term CR requires a major commitment of will power and long-term negative consequences remain to be determined, the concept of a calorie restriction mimetic (CRM) has become a new area of investigation within gerontology. We have proposed that a CRM is a compound that mimics metabolic, hormonal, and physiological effects of CR, activates stress response pathways observed in CR and enhances stress protection, produces CR-like effects on longevity, reduces age-related disease, and maintains more youthful function, all without significantly reducing food intake. Over 12 years ago, we introduced the concept of glycolytic inhibition as a strategy for developing mimetics of CR. We have argued that inhibiting energy utilization as far upstream as possible might offer a broader range of CR-like effects as opposed to targeting a singular molecular target downstream. As the first candidate CRM, 2-deoxyglucose, a known anti-glycolytic, provided a remarkable phenotype of CR, but turned out to produce cardiotoxicity in rats. Since the introduction of 2DG as a candidate CRM, many different targets for development have now been proposed at more downstream sites, including insulin receptor sensitizers, sirtuin activators, and inhibitors of mTOR. This review discusses these various strategies to assess their current status and future potential for this emerging research field.}

When systemic simulations based on the OLHDC model are performed, tumor growth and its morphology are found to be strongly affected by cell-cell adhesion and haptotaxis.

With advances in mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, 90,000 sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation have so far been identified, and several thousand have been associated with human diseases and biological processes               3,4               . For the vast majority of phosphorylation events, it is not yet known which of the more than 300 protein serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases encoded in the human genome are responsible               3               . Here we used synthetic peptide libraries to profile the substrate sequence specificity of 303 Ser/Thr kinases, comprising more than 84\% of those predicted to be active in humans. Viewed in its entirety, the substrate specificity of the kinome was substantially more diverse than expected and was driven extensively by negative selectivity. We used our kinome-wide dataset to computationally annotate and identify the kinases capable of phosphorylating every reported phosphorylation site in the human Ser/Thr phosphoproteome. For the small minority of phosphosites for which the putative protein kinases involved have been previously reported, our predictions were in excellent agreement. When this approach was applied to examine the signalling response of tissues and cell lines to hormones, growth factors, targeted inhibitors and environmental or genetic perturbations, it revealed unexpected insights into pathway complexity and compensation. Overall, these studies reveal the intrinsic substrate specificity of the human Ser/Thr kinome, illuminate cellular signalling responses and provide a resource to link phosphorylation events to biological pathways.},

  abstract = {An important aspect of survival is to assure enough food, water, and oxygen. Here, we describe a recently discovered response that favors survival in times of scarcity, and it is initiated by either ingestion or production of fructose. Unlike glucose, which is a source for immediate energy needs, fructose metabolism results in an orchestrated response to encourage food and water intake, reduce resting metabolism, stimulate fat and glycogen accumulation, and induce insulin resistance as a means to reduce metabolism and preserve glucose supply for the brain. How this survival mechanism affects brain metabolism, which in a resting human amounts to 20\% of the overall energy demand, is only beginning to be understood. Here, we review and extend a previous hypothesis that this survival mechanism has a major role in the development of Alzheimer's disease and may account for many of the early features, including cerebral glucose hypometabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. We propose that the pathway can be engaged in multiple ways, including diets high in sugar, high glycemic carbohydrates, and salt. In summary, we propose that Alzheimer's disease may be the consequence of a maladaptation to an evolutionary-based survival pathway and what had served to enhance survival acutely becomes injurious when engaged for extensive periods. Although more studies are needed on the role of fructose metabolism and its metabolite, uric acid, in Alzheimer's disease, we suggest that both dietary and pharmacologic trials to reduce fructose exposure or block fructose metabolism should be performed to determine whether there is potential benefit in the prevention, management, or treatment of this disease.},

We posit that this ability to generalize arises from a specific representational geometry, that we call abstract and that is referred to as disentangled in machine learning. These abstract representations have been observed in recent neurophysiological studies. However, it is unknown how they emerge. Here, using feedforward neural networks, we demonstrate that the learning of multiple tasks causes abstract representations to emerge, using both supervised and reinforcement learning. We show that these abstract representations enable few-sample learning and reliable generalization on novel tasks. We conclude that abstract representations of sensory and cognitive variables may emerge from the multiple behaviors that animals exhibit in the natural world, and, as a consequence, could be pervasive in high-level brain regions. We also make several specific predictions about which variables will be represented abstractly.},

  abstract = {Abstract Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort 1-- 4 , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined 5 , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences 6,7 . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence--- the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem' 8 --- has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years 9 . Despite recent progress 10-- 14 , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) 15 , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.}

  abstract = {Secretion of growth hormone (GH), and consequently that of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), declines over time until only low levels can be detected in individuals aged \textbackslash geq60 years. This phenomenon, which is known as the `somatopause', has led to recombinant human GH being widely promoted and abused as an antiageing drug, despite lack of evidence of efficacy. By contrast, several mutations that decrease the tone of the GH/IGF-1 axis are associated with extended longevity in mice. In humans, corresponding or similar mutations have been identified, but whether these mutations alter longevity has yet to be established. The powerful effect of reduced GH activity on lifespan extension in mice has generated the hypothesis that pharmaceutically inhibiting, rather than increasing, GH action might delay ageing. Moreover, mice as well as humans with reduced activity of the GH/IGF-1 axis are protected from cancer and diabetes mellitus, two major ageing-related morbidities. Here, we review data on mouse strains with alterations in the GH/IGF-1 axis and their effects on lifespan. The outcome of corresponding or similar mutations in humans is described, as well as the potential mechanisms underlying increased longevity and the therapeutic benefits and risks of medical disruption of the GH/IGF-1 axis in humans.}

Strongly female-biased sex ratios that are repeatedly observed in various arthropods often result from the male-specific lethality (male-killing) induced by maternally inherited symbiotic bacteria such as               Spiroplasma               and               Wolbachia               . However, despite some plausible case reports wherein viruses are raised as male-killers, it is not well understood how viruses, having much smaller genomes than bacteria, are capable of inducing male-killing. Here we show that a maternally inherited double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus belonging to the family Partitiviridae (designated DbMKPV1) induces male-killing in               Drosophila               . DbMKPV1 localizes in the cytoplasm and possesses only four genes, i.e., one gene in each of the four genomic segments (dsRNA1-dsRNA4), in contrast to ca. 1000 or more genes possessed by               Spiroplasma               or               Wolbachia               . We also show that a protein (designated PVMKp1; 330 amino acids in size), encoded by a gene on the dsRNA4 segment, is necessary and sufficient for inducing male-killing. Our results imply that male-killing genes can be easily acquired by symbiotic viruses through reassortment and that symbiotic viruses are hidden players in arthropod evolution. We anticipate that host-manipulating genes possessed by symbiotic viruses can be utilized for controlling arthropods.},

Here we found an ability of hypothermic (+4uC) preservation of fish antifreeze protein (AFP) against rat insulinoma cells denoted as RIN-5F. The preservation ability was compared between type I--III AFPs and antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP), which could be recently mass-prepared by a developed technique utilizing the muscle homogenates, but not the blood serum, of cold-adapted fishes. For AFGP, whose molecular weight is distributed in the range from 2.6 to 34 kDa, only the proteins less than 10 kDa were examined. The viability rate was evaluated by counting of the preserved RIN-5F cells unstained with trypan blue. Significantly, either AFPI or AFPIII dissolved into Euro-Collins (EC) solution at a concentration of 10 mg/ml could preserve approximately 60\% of the cells for 5 days at +4uC. The 5-day preserved RIN-5F cells retained the ability to secrete insulin. Only 2\% of the cells were, however, preserved for 5 days without AFP. Confocal photomicroscopy experiments further showed the significant binding ability of AFP to the cell surface. These results suggest that fish AFP enables 5-day quality storage of the insulinoma cells collected from a donor without freezing.},

Cell-ECM interactions occur at a variety of specialised, multi-protein adhesion complexes that serve to physically link the ECM, predominantly via clustered transmembrane receptors of the integrin family, to the cytoskeleton and the intracellular signalling apparatus. Here we review how the interplay of mechanical forces, biochemical signalling, and molecular self-organisation determines the composition, organisation, mechanosensitivity and dynamics of adhesions. Progress in the identification of core common interactome modules and characterisation of rearrangements in response to force, together with advanced imaging approaches, has improved understanding of adhesion maturation and turnover and the relationships between adhesion structures and functions. Perturbations of adhesion contribute to a broad range of disease and to age-related dysfunction, thus an improved understanding may facilitate therapeutic intervention in these conditions.},

Therefore, sequence similarity based search methods often fails to predict AFPs from sequence databases.

AFP-Pred was trained on the dataset containing 300 AFPs and 300 non-AFPs and tested on the dataset containing 181 AFPs and 9193 non-AFPs. AFP-Pred achieved 81.33\% accuracy from training and 83.38\% from testing. The performance of AFP-Pred was compared with BLAST and HMM. High prediction accuracy and successful of prediction of hypothetical proteins suggests that AFP-Pred can be a useful approach to identify antifreeze proteins from sequence information, irrespective of their sequence similarity.},

These protocells are carbon chemistry based but biochemistry free. The populations share their environment, differing only in that one contains a photocatalyst that confers advantages in reproduction. Competition in the shared environment follows the CEP. Thus, biochemistry is sufficient, not necessary, to drive the CEP. This has implications for protocell research, the origin and early evolution of life, and the laboratory synthesis of life and also relaxes constraints for the potential presence and evolution of generalized life in exoplanets.},

By linking multiple Cas-mediated translational modulators, we designed and built artificial circuits like logic gates, cascades, and half-subtractor circuits. Moreover, we show that various CRISPR-related technologies like anti-CRISPR and split-Cas9 platforms could be similarly repurposed to control translation. Coupling Cas-mediated translational and transcriptional regulation enhanced the complexity of synthetic circuits built by only introducing a few additional elements.

  abstract = {Small beta barrel proteins are attractive targets for computational design because of their considerable functional diversity despite their very small size ({$<$}70 amino acids). However, there are considerable challenges to designing such structures, and there has been little success thus far. Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta energy--based methods and deep learning approaches to design four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful designs with high thermal stability and experimentally determined structures with less than 2.4 \AA{} rmsd from the designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone. The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape space available for designing binders to protein targets of interest.},

The heart of the delayed-choice quantum eraser is in the mutually exclusive quantum feature violating the cause-effect relation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the quantum eraser using coherent photon pairs by the delayed choice of a polarizer placed out of the interferometer. Coherence solutions of the observed quantum eraser are derived from a typical Mach--Zehnder interferometer, where the violation of the cause-effect relation is due to selective measurements of basis choice.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation plays major roles in many biological processes, including aging, carcinogenesis, and development. Analyses of DNA methylation using next-generation sequencing offer a new way to profile and compare methylomes across the genome in the context of aging. We explored genomewide DNA methylation and the effects of short-term calorie restriction (CR) on the methylome of aged rat kidney. Whole-genome methylation of kidney in young (6 months old), old (25 months old), and OCR (old with 4-week, short-term CR) rats was analyzed by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). CpG islands and repetitive regions were hypomethylated, but 50-UTR, exon, and 30-UTR hypermethylated in old and OCR rats. The methylation in the promoter and intron regions was decreased in old rats, but increased in OCR rats. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the hypermethylated promoters in old rats were associated with degenerative phenotypes such as cancer and diabetes. The hypomethylated promoters in old rats related significantly to the chemokine signaling pathway. However, the pathways significantly enriched in old rats were not observed from the differentially methylated promoters in OCR rats. Thus, these findings suggest that short-term CR could partially ameliorate age-related methylation changes in promoters in old rats. From the epigenomic data, we propose that the hypermethylation found in the promoter regions of disease-related genes during aging may indicate increases in susceptibility to agerelated diseases. Therefore, the CR-induced epigenetic changes that ameliorate age-dependent aberrant methylation may be important to CR's health- and life-prolonging effects.}

Here, we developed an improved version of Sniper--Cas9, Sniper2L, which represents an exception to this trade-off trend as it showed higher specificity with retained high activity. We evaluated Sniper2L activities at a large number of target sequences and developed DeepSniper, a deep learning model that can predict the activity of Sniper2L. We also confirmed that Sniper2L can induce highly efficient and specific editing at a large number of target sequences when it is delivered as a ribonucleoprotein complex. Mechanically, the high specificity of Sniper2L originates from its superior ability to avoid unwinding a target DNA containing even a single mismatch. We envision that Sniper2L will be useful when efficient and specific genome editing is required.},

The ECM, traditionally viewed as the structural elements within which cells reside, is actually a functional tissue whose components possess not only scaffolding characteristics, but also growth factor, mitogenic, and other bioactive properties. Although it has been suggested that tissue fibrosis simply reflects an `exuberant' wound-healing response, examination of the ECM and the roles of myofibroblasts during fibrogenesis instead suggest that the organism may be attempting to recapitulate developmental programmes designed to regenerate functional tissue. Evidence of this is provided by the temporospatial re-emergence of embryonic ECM proteins by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts that induce cellular programmatic responses intended to produce a functional tissue. In the setting of wound healing (or physiological fibrosis), this occurs in a highly regulated and exquisitely choreographed fashion which results in cessation of haemorrhage, restoration of barrier integrity, and re-establishment of tissue function. However, pathological tissue fibrosis, which oftentimes causes organ dysfunction and significant morbidity or mortality, likely results from dysregulation of normal wound-healing processes or abnormalities of the process itself. This review will focus on the myofibroblast ECM and its role in both physiological and pathological fibrosis, and will discuss the potential for therapeutically targeting ECM proteins for treatment of fibrotic disorders.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the aging process has long been a biological riddle, because it is difficult to explain the evolution of a trait that has apparently no benefit to the individual. Over 60 years ago, Medawar realized that the force of natural selection declines with chronological age because of unavoidable environmental risks. This forms the basis of the mainstream view that aging arises as a consequence of a declining selection pressure to maintain the physiological functioning of living beings forever. Over recent years, however, a number of articles have appeared that nevertheless propose the existence of specific aging genes; that is, that the aging process is genetically programmed. If this view were correct, it would have serious implications for experiments to understand and postpone aging. Therefore, we studied in detail various specific proposals why aging should be programmed. We find that not a single one withstands close scrutiny of its assumptions or simulation results. Nonprogrammed aging theories based on the insight of Medawar (as further developed by Hamilton and Charlesworth) are still the best explanation for the evolution of the aging process. We hope that this analysis helps to clarify the problems associated with the idea of programmed aging.}

One example, the extracellular contractile injection systems (eCISs), are syringe-like macromolecular complexes that inject protein payloads into eukaryotic cells by driving a spike through the cellular membrane. Recently, eCISs have been found to target mouse cells               1--3               , raising the possibility that these systems could be harnessed for therapeutic protein delivery. However, whether eCISs can function in human cells remains unknown, and the mechanism by which these systems recognize target cells is poorly understood. Here we show that target selection by the               Photorhabdus               virulence cassette (PVC)---an eCIS from the entomopathogenic bacterium               Photorhabdus asymbiotica               ---is mediated by specific recognition of a target receptor by a distal binding element of the PVC tail fibre. Furthermore, using in silico structure-guided engineering of the tail fibre, we show that PVCs can be reprogrammed to target organisms not natively targeted by these systems---including human cells and mice---with efficiencies approaching 100\%. Finally, we show that PVCs can load diverse protein payloads, including Cas9, base editors and toxins, and can functionally deliver them into human cells. Our results demonstrate that PVCs are programmable protein delivery devices with possible applications in gene therapy, cancer therapy and biocontrol.},

The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated during aging and contributes to age-related brain phenotypes. We demonstrate that treatment with the drug-like small-molecule ISR inhibitor ISRIB reverses ISR activation in the brain, as indicated by decreased levels of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2. Furthermore, ISRIB treatment reverses spatial memory deficits and ameliorates working memory in old mice. At the cellular level in the hippocampus, ISR inhibition (i) rescues intrinsic neuronal electrophysiological properties, (ii) restores spine density and (iii) reduces immune profiles, specifically interferon and T cell-mediated responses. Thus, pharmacological interference with the ISR emerges as a promising intervention strategy for combating age-related cognitive decline in otherwise healthy individuals.}

The higher concentration of gut microbiota-- derived butyrate in these young transplanted mice was associated with an increase in the pleiotropic and prolongevity hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). An increase in FGF21 correlated with increased AMPK and SIRT-1 activation and reduced mTOR signaling. Young germ-free mice treated with exogenous sodium butyrate recapitulated the prolongevity phenotype observed in young germ-free mice receiving a gut microbiota transplant from old donor mice. These results suggest that gut microbiota transplants from aged hosts conferred beneficial effects in responsive young recipients.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are abundant on the ocean floor and play important roles in ocean biogeochemistry. In vent ecosystems such as hydrothermal plumes, microorganisms rely on reduced chemicals and gases in hydrothermal fluids to fuel primary production and form diverse and complex microbial communities. However, microbial interactions that drive these complex microbiomes remain poorly understood. Here, we use microbiomes from the Guaymas Basin hydrothermal system in the Pacific Ocean to shed more light on the key species in these communities and their interactions. We built metabolic models from metagenomically assembled genomes (MAGs) and infer possible metabolic exchanges and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events within the community. We highlight possible archaea--archaea and archaea--bacteria interactions and their contributions to the robustness of the community. Cellobiose, D-Mannose 1-phosphate, O               2               , CO               2               , and H               2               S were among the most exchanged metabolites. These interactions enhanced the metabolic capabilities of the community by exchange of metabolites that cannot be produced by any other community member. Archaea from the DPANN group stood out as key microbes, benefiting significantly as acceptors in the community. Overall, our study provides key insights into the microbial interactions that drive community structure and organisation in complex hydrothermal plume microbiomes.},

Poor compliance to long-term dietary restriction, however, hinders the success of this approach. Evidence is now persuasive for a role of resveratrol supplementation (a polyphenol in red grapes) as potential alternative to calorie restriction. This review summarizes the latest literature on the effects and the molecular mechanisms by which calorie restriction and resveratrol confer health benefits. Resveratrol activates SIRT1 and the associated improvement in energy utilization and insulin sensitivity closely resembles the benefits of calorie restriction. Current data largely support resveratrol as a potential calorie restriction mimetic to improve metabolic and probably functional health. Future studies which characterize the bioavailability and efficacy of resveratrol supplementation are critical to provide evidence for its long-term health benefits.}

We designed a Python module for ontology-oriented programming. It allows access to the entities of an OWL ontology as if they were objects in the programming language. We propose a simple high-level syntax for managing classes and the associated ``role-filler'' constraints. We also propose an algorithm for performing local closed world reasoning in simple situations. Results: We developed Owlready, a Python module for a high-level access to OWL ontologies. The paper describes the architecture and the syntax of the module version 2. It details how we integrated the OWL ontology model with the Python object model. The paper provides examples based on Gene Ontology (GO). We also demonstrate the interest of Owlready in a use case focused on the automatic comparison of the contraindications of several drugs. This use case illustrates the use of the specific syntax proposed for manipulating classes and for performing local closed world reasoning. Conclusion: Owlready has been successfully used in a medical research project. It has been published as Open-Source software and then used by many other researchers. Future developments will focus on the support of vagueness and additional non-monotonic reasoning feature, and automatic dialog box generation.}

Though bidirectional signaling between ECM and cells is fundamental to cell biology, it is challenging to gain high-resolution structural information on cellular responses to the matrix microenvironment. Here we used cryo-scanning transmission electron tomography (CSTET) to reveal the nanometer- to micron-scale organization of major fibroblast ECM components in a nativelike context, while simultaneously visualizing internal cell ultrastructure including organelles and cytoskeleton. In addition to extending current models for collagen VI fibril organization, three-dimensional views of thick cell regions and surrounding matrix showed how ECM networks impact the structures and dynamics of intracellular organelles and how cells remodel ECM. Collagen VI and fibronectin were seen to distribute in fundamentally different ways in the cell microenvironment and perform distinct roles in supporting and interacting with cells. This work demonstrates that CSTET provides a new perspective for the study of ECM in cell biology, highlighting labeled extracellular elements against a backdrop of unlabeled but morphologically identifiable cellular features with nanometer resolution detail.},

Heart failure is associated with reduced cardiac pump function, autonomic dysregulation, systemic inflammation and sleep-disordered breathing; these morbidities are exacerbated by peripheral chemoreceptor dysfunction. We reveal that in heart failure the carotid body generates spontaneous, episodic burst discharges coincident with the onset of disordered breathing in male rats. Purinergic (P2X3) receptors were upregulated two-fold in peripheral chemosensory afferents in heart failure, and when antagonized abolished these episodic discharges, normalized both peripheral chemoreceptor sensitivity and the breathing pattern, reinstated autonomic balance, improved cardiac function, and reduced both inflammation and biomarkers of cardiac failure. Aberrant ATP transmission in the carotid body triggers episodic discharges that via P2X3 receptors play a crucial role in the progression of heart failure and as such offer a distinct therapeutic angle to reverse multiple components of its pathogenesis.},

We examine lateral intraparietal area (LIP) responses during a visual motion delayed-match-to-category task. We consider two pairs of male macaque monkeys with different training histories: one trained only on the categorization task, and another first trained to perform fine motion-direction discrimination (i.e., pretrained). We introduce a novel analytical approach---generalized multilinear models---to quantify low-dimensional, task-relevant components in population activity. During the categorization task, we found stronger cosine-like motion-direction tuning in the pretrained monkeys than in the category-only monkeys, and that the pretrained monkeys' performance depended more heavily on fine discrimination between sample and test stimuli. These results suggest that sensory representations in LIP depend on the sequence of tasks that the animals have learned, underscoring the importance of considering training history in studies with complex behavioral tasks.},

  abstract = {Mutations accumulate within somatic cells and have been proposed to contribute to aging. It is unclear what level of mutation burden may be required to consistently reduce cellular lifespan. Human cancers driven by a mutator phenotype represent an intriguing model to test this hypothesis, since they carry the highest mutation burdens of any human cell. However, it remains technically challenging to measure the replicative lifespan of individual mammalian cells. Here, we modeled the consequences of cancer-related mutator phenotypes on lifespan using yeast defective for mismatch repair (MMR) and/or leading strand (Pol{$\epsilon$}) or lagging strand (Pol{$\delta$}) DNA polymerase proofreading. Only haploid mutator cells with significant lifetime mutation accumulation (MA) exhibited shorter lifespans. Diploid strains, derived by mating haploids of various genotypes, carried variable numbers of fixed mutations and a range of mutator phenotypes. Some diploid strains with fewer than two mutations per megabase displayed a 25\% decrease in lifespan, suggesting that moderate numbers of random heterozygous mutations can increase mortality rate. As mutation rates and burdens climbed, lifespan steadily eroded. Strong diploid mutator phenotypes produced a form of genetic anticipation with regard to aging, where the longer a lineage persisted, the shorter lived cells became. Using MA lines, we established a relationship between mutation burden and lifespan, as well as population doubling time. Our observations define a threshold of random mutation burden that consistently decreases cellular longevity in diploid yeast cells. Many human cancers carry comparable mutation burdens, suggesting that while cancers appear immortal, individual cancer cells may suffer diminished lifespan due to accrued mutation burden.}

As the two surfaces approach each other to be within a few molecular layers apart, normal force oscillations between the two surfaces are observed which are very similar to those observed in surface force measurements. It is shown that the layering transition of the liquid film is an abrupt liquid-to-solid phase transition. The nucleation of the solid phase starts at the central region of the confined film that can support a finite shear stress. It is found that this phase transition behaviour does not critically depend on the contact nature between the liquid and solid walls. Furthermore, the formation of the close-packed solidified film is confinement induced, rather than pressure induced.},

  abstract = {Aging is an elusive property of life, and many important questions about aging depend on its definition. This article proposes to draw a definition from the scien-tific literature on aging. First, a broad review reveals five features commonly used to define aging: structural damage, functional decline, depletion, typical phenotypic changes or their cause, and increasing probability of death. Anything that can be called `aging' must present one of these features. Then, although many conditions are not consensual instances of aging, aging is consensually described as a process of loss characterized by a rate and resulting from the counteraction of protective mechanisms against mechanisms that limit lifespan. Beyond such an abstract defini-tion, no one has yet succeeded in defining aging by a specific mechanism of aging because of an explanatory gap between such a mechanism and lifespan, a consensual explanandum of a theory of aging. By contrast, a sound theoretical definition can be obtained by revisiting the evolutionary theory of aging. Based on this theory, aging evolves thanks to the impossibility that natural selection eliminates late traits that are neutral mainly due to decreasing selective pressure. Yet, the results of physiolog-ical research suggest that this theory should be revised to also account for the small number of different aging pathways and for the existence of mechanisms counteract-ing these pathways, that must, on the contrary, have been selected. A synthetic, but temporary definition of aging can finally be proposed.}

In recent years, however, several authors opposed this predominant view and repeatedly suggested that not only is aging an adaptation but that it is the result of a specific aging program. This issue almost instantaneously became somewhat controversial and many important authors produced substantial works refuting the notion of the aging program. In this article we review the current state of the debate and list the most important arguments proposed by both sides. Furthermore, although classical interpretations of the evolution of aging are in sharp contrast with the idea of programmed aging, we suggest that the truth might in fact very well lie somewhere in between. We also propose our own interpretation which states that although aging is in essence inevitable and results from damage accumulation rather than from a specific program, the actual rate of aging in nature may still be adaptive to some extent.}

  abstract = {Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and liquid-vapor molecular dynamics (LVMD) simulations are performed to investigate the squeezing and phase transition of a simple liquid argon film confined between two solid surfaces. Simulation results show that the LVMD simulation is capable of capturing the major thermodynamic equilibrium states of the confined film, as predicted by the GCMC simulations. Moreover, the LVMD simulations reveal the non-equilibrium squeeze out dynamics of the confined film. The study shows that the solvation force hysteresis, observed in many surface force experiments, is attributed to two major effects. The first is related to the unstable jumps during the laying transitions of the confined film, in which the gradient of force profile is larger than the driving spring constant. The second effect is related to the squeeze out dynamics of the confined film even though the first effect is absent. In general, these two dynamic processes are non-equilibrium in nature and involve significant energy dissipations, resulting in the force hysteresis.},

A liquid--vapor molecular ensemble has been designed for this purpose. We find, however, that only the two-layer hydration water can support a repulsive hydration force, and beyond this thickness the overall forces are attractive. From the hydrodynamic pressure developed during a normal approach and dynamic squeeze-out, we estimate that the viscosity of confined hydration water in the thickness of 0.7--1.35 nm is about 5--16 times the bulk value.

The molecular mechanisms driving aging process and the associated cognitive decline are not fully understood. The hypothalamus acts as the arbiter that orchestrates systemic aging through neuroinflammatory signaling. Our recent findings revealed that Menin plays important roles in neuroinflammation and brain development. Here, we found that the hypothalamic Menin signaling diminished in aged mice, which correlates with systemic aging and cognitive deficits. Restoring Menin expression in ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus (VMH) of aged mice extended lifespan, improved learning and memory, and ameliorated aging biomarkers, while inhibiting Menin in VMH of middle-aged mice induced premature aging and accelerated cognitive decline. We further found that Menin epigenetically regulates neuroinflammatory and metabolic pathways, including D-serine metabolism. Aging-associated Menin reduction led to impaired D-serine release by VMH-hippocampus neural circuit, while D-serine supplement rescued cognitive decline in aged mice. Collectively, VMH Menin serves as a key regulator of systemic aging and aging-related cognitive decline.},

  abstract = {Sleep quality declines with age; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We found that hyperexcitable hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/OX) neurons drive sleep fragmentation during aging. In aged mice, Hcrt neurons exhibited more frequent neuronal activity epochs driving wake bouts, and optogenetic activation of Hcrt neurons elicited more prolonged wakefulness. Aged Hcrt neurons showed hyperexcitability with lower KCNQ2 expression and impaired M-current, mediated by KCNQ2/3 channels. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed adaptive changes to Hcrt neuron loss in the aging brain. Disruption of Kcnq2/3 genes in Hcrt neurons of young mice destabilized sleep, mimicking aging-associated sleep fragmentation, whereas the KCNQ-selective activator flupirtine hyperpolarized Hcrt neurons and rejuvenated sleep architecture in aged mice. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism underlying sleep instability during aging and a strategy to improve sleep continuity. , Aging and sleep disruption In humans, the deterioration of sleep quality during aging is one of the most prevalent complaints. In an animal model, Li et al . found that aging correlated with enhanced spontaneous activity of wake-promoting brain areas during sleep (see the Perspective by Jacobson and Hoyer). Hypocretin-expressing neurons were more active during sleep, raising the chances of brief arousals and thus causing sleep to be more fragmented. The excitability of hypocretin neurons in aged brain tissue was heightened, possibly because of decreased expression of a subpopulation of potassium channels. Aging-related sleep fragmentation may therefore be due to altered intrinsic excitability of arousal-promoting neurons. --- PRS , Down-regulation of potassium channels causes hyperexcitability of hypocretin neurons and leads to age related fragmentation of sleep. , INTRODUCTION Sleep destabilization is strongly associated with aging and cognitive function decline. Despite sleep fragmentation being central to the most prevalent complaints of sleep problems in elderly populations, the mechanistic underpinnings of sleep instability remain elusive. Fragmented sleep during aging has been observed across species, indicating conserved underlying mechanisms across the phylogenetic tree. Therefore, understanding why the aging brain fails to consolidate sleep may shed light on translational applications for improving the sleep quality of aged individuals. RATIONALE We hypothesized that the decline in sleep quality could be due to malfunction of the neural circuits associated with sleep/wake control. It has been established that hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/OX) neuronal activity is tightly associated with wakefulness and initiates and maintains the wake state. In this study, we investigated whether the intrinsic excitability of Hcrt neurons is altered, leading to a destabilized control of sleep/wake states during aging. RESULTS Aged mice exhibited sleep fragmentation and a significant loss of Hcrt neurons. Hcrt neurons manifested a more frequent firing pattern, driving wake bouts and disrupting sleep continuity in aged mice. Aged Hcrt neurons were capable of eliciting more prolonged wake bouts upon optogenetic stimulations. These results suggested that hyperexcitability of Hcrt neurons emerges with age. Patch clamp recording in genetically identified Hcrt neurons revealed distinct intrinsic properties between the young and aged groups. Aged Hcrt neurons were hyperexcitable with depolarized membrane potentials (RMPs) and a smaller difference between RMP and the firing threshold. Aged Hcrt neurons expressing ChR2-eYFP were more sensitive to optogenetic stimulations, with a smaller-amplitude attenuation upon repetitive light pulse stimulations. More spikelets were generated in aged Hcrt neurons upon current injections. Recording from non-Hcrt neurons postsynaptic to Hcrt neurons revealed that optogenetic stimulation of Hcrt neurons expressing ChR2-eYFP reliably evoked time-locked postsynaptic currents (PSCs) after optogenetic stimulation more often in the aged group. Aged Hcrt neurons were characterized with a functional impairment of repolarizing M-current mediated by KCNQ2/3 channels and an anatomical loss of KCNQ2, revealed with array tomography at ultrastructural resolution. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) revealed molecular adaptions, including up-regulated prepro- Hcrt mRNA expression and a smaller fraction of Kcnq family subtypes Kcnq1 / 2 / 3 / 5 in aged Hcrt neurons. CRISPR/SaCas9-- mediated disruption of Kcnq2 / 3 genes selectively in Hcrt neurons was sufficient to recapitulate the aging-associated sleep fragmentation trait in young mice. Pharmacological augmentation of M-current repolarized the RMP, suppressed spontaneous firing activity in aged Hcrt neurons, and consolidated sleep stability in aged mice. Sleep fragmentation in a narcolepsy mouse model with genetic ablation of Hcrt neurons at young ages manifested a mechanism other than hyperexcitable arousal-promoting Hcrt neurons that drives sleep fragmentation during healthy aging. CONCLUSION Our data indicate that emerging hyperexcitability of arousal-promoting Hcrt neurons is strongly associated with fragmented sleep in aged mice, which display a lowered sleep-to-wake transition threshold defined for Hcrt neuronal activity. We have demonstrated that the down-regulation of KCNQ2/3 channels compromising repolarization drives Hcrt neuronal hyperexcitability, which leads to sleep instability during aging. Pharmacological remedy of sleep continuity through targeting KCNQ2/3 channels in aged mice confers a potential translational therapy strategy for improving sleep quality in aged individuals. Hyperexcitable Hcrt neurons drive sleep instability during aging. Elevated excitability of Hcrt neurons with depolarized RMPs and adaptive up-regulation of prepro- Hcrt mRNA expression converge to drive sleep/wake instability in the aged brain with substantial Hcrt neuron loss. Hyperexcitable aged Hcrt neurons express functional impairment of KCNQ2/3 channel-- mediated M-current and an anatomical loss of KCNQ2, compromising the neurons to repolarize.}

However, the cell-type-specific functions of APOE4 in relation to AD pathology remain understudied. Here, we utilize CRISPR/Cas9 and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to examine APOE4 effects on human brain cell types. Transcriptional profiling identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes in each cell type, with the most affected involving synaptic function (neurons), lipid metabolism (astrocytes), and immune response (microglia-like cells). APOE4 neurons exhibited increased synapse number and elevated Ab42 secretion relative to isogenic APOE3 cells while APOE4 astrocytes displayed impaired Ab uptake and cholesterol accumulation. Notably, APOE4 microglia-like cells exhibited altered morphologies, which correlated with reduced Ab phagocytosis. Consistently, converting APOE4 to APOE3 in brain cell types from sAD iPSCs was sufficient to attenuate multiple AD-related pathologies. Our study establishes a reference for human cell-type-specific changes associated with the APOE4 variant.}

  abstract = {The replicative life span (RLS) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been established as a model for the genetic regulation of longevity despite the inherent difficulty of the RLS assay, which requires separation of mother and daughter cells by micromanipulation after every division. Here we present the mother enrichment program (MEP), an inducible genetic system in which mother cells maintain a normal RLS--- a median of 36 generations in the diploid MEP strain--- while the proliferative potential of daughter cells is eliminated. Thus, the viability of a population over time becomes a function of RLS, and it displays features of a survival curve such as changes in hazard rate with age. We show that viability of mother cells in liquid culture is regulated by SIR2 and FOB1, two opposing regulators of RLS in yeast. We demonstrate that viability curves of these short- and long-lived strains can be easily distinguished from wild type, using a colony formation assay. This provides a simplified screening method for identifying genetic or environmental factors that regulate RLS. Additionally, the MEP can provide a cohort of cells at any stage of their life span for the analysis of ageassociated phenotypes. These capabilities effectively remove the hurdles presented by RLS analysis that have hindered S. cerevisiae aging studies since their inception 50 years ago.}

  abstract = {Neurons require large amounts of energy, but whether they can perform glycolysis or require glycolysis to maintain energy remains unclear. Using metabolomics, we show that human neurons do metabolize glucose through glycolysis and can rely on glycolysis to supply tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites. To investigate the requirement for glycolysis, we generated mice with postnatal deletion of either the dominant neuronal glucose transporter (GLUT3cKO) or the neuronal-enriched pyruvate kinase isoform (PKM1cKO) in CA1 and other hippocampal neurons. GLUT3cKO and PKM1cKO mice show age-dependent learning and memory deficits. Hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging shows that female PKM1cKO mice have increased pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, whereas female GLUT3cKO mice have decreased conversion, body weight, and brain volume. GLUT3KO neurons also have decreased cytosolic glucose and ATP at nerve terminals, with spatial genomics and metabolomics revealing compensatory changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics and galactose metabolism. Therefore, neurons metabolize glucose through glycolysis in vivo and require glycolysis for normal function.},

Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has been shown to prevent muscle function decline from obesogenic challenges; however, its mechanism remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that TRF upregulates genes involved in glycine production (               Sardh               and               CG5955               ) and utilization (               Gnmt               ), while               Dgat2               , involved in triglyceride synthesis is downregulated in               Drosophila               models of diet- and genetic-induced obesity. Muscle-specific knockdown of               Gnmt               ,               Sardh               , and               CG5955               lead to muscle dysfunction, ectopic lipid accumulation, and loss of TRF-mediated benefits, while knockdown of               Dgat2               retains muscle function during aging and reduces ectopic lipid accumulation. Further analyses demonstrate that TRF upregulates the purine cycle in a diet-induced obesity model and AMPK signaling-associated pathways in a genetic-induced obesity model. Overall, our data suggest that TRF improves muscle function through modulations of common and distinct pathways under different obesogenic challenges and provides potential targets for obesity treatments.},

Here, we restored this communication with a digital bridge between the brain and spinal cord that enabled an individual with chronic tetraplegia to stand and walk naturally in community settings. This brain--spine interface (BSI) consists of fully implanted recording and stimulation systems that establish a direct link between cortical signals               3               and the analogue modulation of epidural electrical stimulation targeting the spinal cord regions involved in the production of walking               4--6               . A highly reliable BSI is calibrated within a few minutes. This reliability has remained stable over one year, including during independent use at home. The participant reports that the BSI enables natural control over the movements of his legs to stand, walk, climb stairs and even traverse complex terrains. Moreover, neurorehabilitation supported by the BSI improved neurological recovery. The participant regained the ability to walk with crutches overground even when the BSI was switched off. This digital bridge establishes a framework to restore natural control of movement after paralysis.},

This study investigates whether or not berberine (BBR) could reduce TMAO production in the gut microbiota and treat atherosclerosis. Effects of BBR on TMAO production in the gut microbiota, as well as on plaque development in atherosclerosis were investigated in the culture of animal intestinal bacterial, HFD-fed animals and atherosclerotic patients, respectively. We found that oral BBR in animals lowers TMAO biosynthesis in intestine through interacting with the enzyme/co-enzyme of choline-trimethylamine lyase (CutC) and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) in the gut microbiota. This action was performed by BBR's metabolite dihydroberberine (a reductive BBR by nitroreductase in the gut microbiota), via a vitamine-like effect down-regulating Choline-TMA-TMAO production pathway. Oral BBR decreased TMAO production in animal intestine, lowered blood TMAO and interrupted plaque formation in blood vessels in the HFD-fed hamsters. Moreover, 21 patients with atherosclerosis exhibited the average decrease of plaque score by 3.2\% after oral BBR (0.5\,g, bid) for 4 months (*               P               \,{$<$}\,0.05,               n               \,=\,21); whereas the plaque score in patients treated with rosuvastatin plus aspirin, or clopidogrel sulfate or ticagrelor (4 months,               n               \,=\,12) increased by 1.9\%. TMA and TMAO in patients decreased by 38 and 29\% in faeces (*               P               \,{$<$}\,0.05; *               P               \,{$<$}\,0.05), and 37 and 35\% in plasma (***               P               \,{$<$}\,0.001; *               P               \,{$<$}\,0.05), after 4 months on BBR. BBR might treat atherosclerotic plaque at least partially through decreasing TMAO in a mode of action similar to that of vitamins.},

  abstract = {Accurate and physiologically meaningful biomarkers for human aging are key to assessing antiaging therapies. Given ethnic differences in health, diet, lifestyle, behavior, environmental exposures, and even average rate of biological aging, it stands to reason that aging clocks trained on datasets obtained from specific ethnic populations are more likely to account for these potential confounding factors, resulting in an enhanced capacity to predict chronological age and quantify biological age. Here, we present a deep learning-based hematological aging clock modeled using the large combined dataset of Canadian, South Korean, and Eastern European population blood samples that show increased predictive accuracy in individual populations compared to population specific hematologic aging clocks. The performance of models was also evaluated on publicly available samples of the American population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In addition, we explored the association between age predicted by both population specific and combined hematological clocks and all-cause mortality. Overall, this study suggests (a) the population specificity of aging patterns and (b) hematologic clocks predicts all-cause mortality. The proposed models were added to the freely-available Aging.AI system expanding the range of tools for analysis of human aging.}

As demand for computation grows, it has become critical for these algorithms to be as performant as possible. Whereas remarkable progress has been achieved in the past               2               , making further improvements on the efficiency of these routines has proved challenging for both human scientists and computational approaches. Here we show how artificial intelligence can go beyond the current state of the art by discovering hitherto unknown routines. To realize this, we formulated the task of finding a better sorting routine as a single-player game. We then trained a new deep reinforcement learning agent, AlphaDev, to play this game. AlphaDev discovered small sorting algorithms from scratch that outperformed previously known human benchmarks. These algorithms have been integrated into the LLVM standard C++ sort library               3               . This change to this part of the sort library represents the replacement of a component with an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We also present results in extra domains, showcasing the generality of the approach.},

  abstract = {Sensitive and specific biomarkers of ageing are needed to evaluate interventions to extend health span. However, there is growing evidence that information provided by candidate biomarkers may change with age itself. Little is yet known about the value of candidate biomarkers in those over 85 years, currently the fastest growing population sub-group in many countries. This study assessed a large panel of candidate biomarkers in a cohort of 85 years old by studying comparative associations with health status. Using a cross-sectional sample of 852 individuals aged 85, we performed uni- and multi-variable analyses of associations between 74 candidate biomarkers and 4 health-status measures: viz. multimorbidity, cognitive impairment, disability and proximity to death as measured by mortality within 1.5 years. We defined as most informative any measures that were significantly associated with at least two of the health-status measures in multivariable analyses in this age group. 10 out of 74 tested candidates fulfilled this criterion, while several proposed biomarkers of ageing, notably inflammation and immune risk markers and telomere length, did not. As future data accrues on health outcomes within the cohort, it will become possible also to evaluate the predictive value of these and others of the candidate biomarkers.}

  abstract = {RAP1 is one of the components of shelterin, the capping complex at chromosome ends or telomeres, although its role in telomere length maintenance and protection has remained elusive. RAP1 also binds subtelomeric repeats and along chromosome arms, where it regulates gene expression and has been shown to function in metabolism control. Telomerase is the enzyme that elongates telomeres, and its deficiency causes a premature aging in humans and mice. We describe an unanticipated genetic interaction between RAP1 and telomerase. While RAP1 deficiency alone does not impact on mouse survival, mice lacking both RAP1 and telomerase show a progressively decreased survival with increasing mouse generations compared to telomerase single mutants. Telomere shortening is more pronounced in Rap1\`A/\`A Terc\`A/\`A doubly deficient mice than in the single-mutant Terc\`A/\`A counterparts, leading to an earlier onset of telomere-induced DNA damage and degenerative pathologies. Telomerase deficiency abolishes obesity and liver steatohepatitis provoked by RAP1 deficiency. Using genomewide ChIP sequencing, we find that progressive telomere shortening owing to telomerase deficiency leads to re-localization of RAP1 from telomeres and subtelomeric regions to extratelomeric sites in a genomewide manner. These findings suggest that although in the presence of sufficient telomere reserve RAP1 is not a key factor for telomere maintenance and protection, it plays a crucial role in the context of telomerase deficiency, thus in agreement with its evolutionary conservation as a telomere component from yeast to humans.}

Here, we investigated neural responses to gastrointestinal sensation using a minimally invasive mechanosensory probe by quantifying brain, stomach, and perceptual responses following the ingestion of a vibrating capsule. Participants successfully perceived capsule stimulation under two vibration conditions (normal and enhanced), as evidenced by above chance accuracy scores. Perceptual accuracy improved significantly during the enhanced relative to normal stimulation, which was associated with faster stimulation detection and reduced reaction time variability. Capsule stimulation induced late neural responses in parieto-occipital electrodes near the midline. Moreover, these `gastric evoked potentials' showed intensity-dependent increases in amplitude and were significantly correlated with perceptual accuracy. Our results replicated in a separate experiment, and abdominal X-ray imaging localized most capsule stimulations to the gastroduodenal segments. Combined with our prior observation that a Bayesian model is capable of estimating computational parameters of gut-brain mechanosensation, these findings highlight a unique form of enterically-focused sensory monitoring within the human brain, with implications for understanding gut feelings and gut-brain interactions in healthy and clinical populations.},

Sleep is one of the processes deeply affected by aging; however few studies evaluating sleep in long-lived individuals (aged over 85) have been reported to date. The aim of this study was to characterize the sleep patterns and biochemical profile of oldest old individuals (N = 10, age 85-- 105 years old) and compare them to young adults (N = 15, age 20-- 30 years old) and older adults (N = 13, age 60-- 70 years old). All subjects underwent full-night polysomnography, 1-week of actigraphic recording and peripheral blood collection. Sleep electroencephalogram spectral analysis was also performed. The oldest old individuals showed lower sleep efficiency and REM sleep when compared to the older adults, while stage N3 percentage and delta power were similar across the groups. Oldest old individuals maintained strictly regular sleep-wake schedules and also presented higher HDL-cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels than older adults. The present study revealed novel data regarding specific sleep patterns and maintenance of slow wave sleep in the oldest old group. Taken together with the favorable lipid profile, these results contribute with evidence to the importance of sleep and lipid metabolism regulation in the maintenance of longevity in humans.}

Second, we examine priors over tree parameters and show that a set of assumptions similar to (Heckerman and al., 1995) constrain the tree parameter priors to be a compactly parametrized product of Dirichlet distributions. Besides allowing for exact Bayesian learning, these results permit us to formulate a new class of tractable latent variable models in which the likelihood of a data point is computed through an ensemble average over tree structures.}

  abstract = {Abstract An organism's ability to perceive and respond to changes in its environment is crucial for its health and survival. Here we reveal how the most well-studied longevity intervention, dietary restriction, acts in-part through a cell non-autonomous signaling pathway that is inhibited by the presence of attractive smells. Using an intestinal reporter for a key gene induced by dietary restriction but suppressed by attractive smells, we identify three compounds that block food odor effects in C. elegans , thereby increasing longevity as dietary restriction mimetics. These compounds clearly implicate serotonin and dopamine in limiting lifespan in response to food odor. We further identify a chemosensory neuron that likely perceives food odor, an enteric neuron that signals through the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A/SER-4, and a dopaminergic neuron that signals through the dopamine receptor DRD2/DOP-3. Aspects of this pathway are conserved in D. melanogaster . Thus, blocking food odor signaling through antagonism of serotonin or dopamine receptors is a plausible approach to mimic the benefits of dietary restriction.}

However, many of these approaches neglect isoform-level information and thus do not capture the extent of alternative splicing within the system. Here, we present an integrated short- and long-read single-cell RNA-seq analysis of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We demonstrate that over half of genes detected in standard short-read single-cell analyses are expressed as multiple, often functionally distinct, isoforms, including many transcription factors and key cytokine receptors. We observe global and HSC-specific changes in gene expression with ageing but limited impact of ageing on isoform usage. Integrating single-cell and cell-type-specific isoform landscape in haematopoiesis thus provides a new reference for comprehensive molecular profiling of heterogeneous tissues, as well as novel insights into transcriptional complexity, cell-type-specific splicing events and consequences of ageing.},

Here, we directly compare in mice the two diets used in the primate studies focusing on three paradigms: ad libitum (AL), 30\% calorie restriction (CR), and single-meal feeding (MF), which accounts for differences in energy density and caloric intake consumed by the AL mice. MF and CR regimes enhanced longevity regardless of diet composition, which alone had no significant impact within feeding regimens. Like CR animals, MF mice ate quickly, imposing periods of extended daily fasting on themselves that produced significant improvements in morbidity and mortality compared with AL. These health and survival benefits conferred by periods of extended daily fasting, independent of dietary composition, have major implications for human health and clinical applicability.}

We characterized age-associated alterations in immune cells across multiple mouse organs using single-cell RNA and antigen receptor sequencing and flow cytometry-based validation. We defined organ-specific and common immune alterations and identified a subpopulation of age-associated granzyme K (GZMK)-expressing CD8+ T (Taa) cells that are distinct from T effector memory (Tem) cells. Taa cells were highly clonal, had specific epigenetic and transcriptional signatures, developed in response to an aged host environment, and expressed markers of exhaustion and tissue homing. Activated Taa cells were the primary source of GZMK, which enhanced inflammatory functions of non-immune cells. In humans, proportions of the circulating GZMK+CD8+ T cell population that shares transcriptional and epigenetic signatures with mouse Taa cells increased during healthy aging. These results identify GZMK+ Taa cells as a potential target to address age-associated dysfunctions of the immune system.}

  abstract = {The brain is arguably the most powerful computation system known. It is extremely efficient in processing large amounts of information and can discern signals from noise, adapt, and filter faulty information all while running on only 20 watts of power. The human brain's processing efficiency, progressive learning, and plasticity are unmatched by any computer system. Recent advances in stem cell technology have elevated the field of cell culture to higher levels of complexity, such as the development of three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids that recapitulate human brain functionality better than traditional monolayer cell systems. Organoid Intelligence (OI) aims to harness the innate biological capabilities of brain organoids for biocomputing and synthetic intelligence by interfacing them with computer technology. With the latest strides in stem cell technology, bioengineering, and machine learning, we can explore the ability of brain organoids to compute, and store given information (input), execute a task (output), and study how this affects the structural and functional connections in the organoids themselves. Furthermore, understanding how learning generates and changes patterns of connectivity in organoids can shed light on the early stages of cognition in the human brain. Investigating and understanding these concepts is an enormous, multidisciplinary endeavor that necessitates the engagement of both the scientific community and the public. Thus, on Feb 22--24 of 2022, the Johns Hopkins University held the first Organoid Intelligence Workshop to form an OI Community and to lay out the groundwork for the establishment of OI as a new scientific discipline. The potential of OI to revolutionize computing, neurological research, and drug development was discussed, along with a vision and roadmap for its development over the coming decade.},

We show that most yeast cells arrest in G1 before death with low nuclear levels of Cln3, a key G1 cyclin extremely sensitive to chaperone status. Chaperone availability is seriously compromised in aged cells, and the G1 arrest coincides with massive aggregation of a metastable chaperone-activity reporter. Moreover, G1-cyclin overexpression increases lifespan in a chaperone-dependent manner. As a key prediction of a model integrating autocatalytic protein aggregation and a minimal Start network, enforced protein aggregation causes a severe reduction in lifespan, an effect that is greatly alleviated by increased expression of specific chaperones or cyclin Cln3. Overall, our data show that proteostasis breakdown, by compromising chaperone activity and G1-cyclin function, causes an irreversible arrest in G1, configuring a molecular pathway postulating proteostasis decay as a key contributing effector of cell senescence.}

  abstract = {Quantum computers hold the promise of executing tasks beyond the capability of classical computers. Noise competes with coherent evolution and destroys long-range correlations, making it an outstanding challenge to fully leverage the computation power of near-term quantum processors. We report Random Circuit Sampling (RCS) experiments where we identify distinct phases driven by the interplay between quantum dynamics and noise. Using cross-entropy benchmarking, we observe phase boundaries which can define the computational complexity of noisy quantum evolution. We conclude by presenting an RCS experiment with 70 qubits at 24 cycles. We estimate the computational cost against improved classical methods and demonstrate that our experiment is beyond the capabilities of existing classical supercomputers.},

  abstract = {Coronaviruses (CoV) belong to the large family Coronaviridae within the order of Nidovirales. Among them, several human pathogenic strains (HCoV) are known to mainly cause respiratory diseases. While most strains contribute to common cold-like illnesses others lead to severe infections. Most prominent representatives are SARSCoV and MERS-CoV, which can lead to fatal infections with around 10\% and 39\% mortality, respectively. This resulted in 8098 casualties in the 2002/2003 SARS-CoV outbreak and in 1806 documented human infections (September 2016) during the recent on-going MERS-CoV outbreak in Saudi Arabia. Currently patients receive treatment focusing on the symptoms connected to the disease rather than addressing the virus as the cause. Therefore, additional treatment options are urgently needed which would ideally be widely available and show a broad affectivity against different human CoVs. Here we show that D, L-lysine acetylsalicylate + glycine sold as ``Asprin i.v. 500mg\textregistered{} '' (LASAG), which is an approved drug inter alia in the treatment of acute pain, migraine and fever, impairs propagation of different CoV including the highly-pathogenic MERS-CoV in vitro. We demonstrate that the LASAG-dependent impact on virus-induced NF-{$\kappa$}B activity coincides with (i) reduced viral titres, (ii) decreased viral protein accumulation and viral RNA synthesis and (iii) impaired formation of viral replication transcription complexes.}

Metazoans efficiently clear readthrough proteins, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells that readthrough proteins are targeted by a coupled, two-level quality control pathway involving the BAG6 chaperone complex and the ribosome-collision-sensing protein GCN1. Readthrough proteins with hydrophobic C-terminal extensions (CTEs) are recognized by SGTABAG6 and ubiquitylated by RNF126 for proteasomal degradation. Additionally, cotranslational mRNA decay initiated by GCN1 and CCR4/NOT limits the accumulation of readthrough products. Unexpectedly, selective ribosome profiling uncovered a general role of GCN1 in regulating translation dynamics when ribosomes collide at nonoptimal codons, enriched in 30 UTRs, transmembrane proteins, and collagens. GCN1 dysfunction increasingly perturbs these protein classes during aging, resulting in mRNA and proteome imbalance. Our results define GCN1 as a key factor acting during translation in maintaining protein homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Ontologies are intended to capture and formalize a domain of knowledge. The ontologies comprising the Open Biological Ontologies (OBO) project, which includes the Gene Ontology (GO), are formalizations of various domains of biological knowledge. Ontologies within OBO typically lack computable definitions that serve to differentiate a term from other similar terms. The computer is unable to determine the meaning of a term, which presents problems for tools such as automated reasoners. Reasoners can be of enormous benefit in managing a complex ontology. OBO term names frequently implicitly encode the kind of definitions that can be used by computational tools, such as automated reasoners. The definitions encoded in the names are not easily amenable to computation, because the names are ostensibly natural language phrases designed for human users. These names are highly regular in their grammar, and can thus be treated as valid sentences in some formal or computable language. With a description of the rules underlying this formal language, term names can be parsed to derive computable definitions, which can then be reasoned over. This paper describes the effort to elucidate that language, called Obol, and the attempts to reason over the resulting definitions. The current implementation finds unique non-trivial definitions for around half of the terms in the GO, and has been used to find 223 missing relationships, which have since been added to the ontology. Obol has utility as an ontology maintenance tool, and as a means of generating computable definitions for a whole ontology.}

Such microrobots can be tethered (e.g., smart microcatheters, microendoscopes) or untethered (e.g., cell-based drug delivery systems). Active motion and multiple functionalities, distinguishing microrobots from mere passive carriers and conventional nanomedicines, can be achieved through external control with physical fields such as magnetism or ultrasound. Here we give an overview of the key challenges in the field of assisted reproduction and how these new technologies could, in the future, enable assisted fertilization in vivo and enhance embryo implantation. As a case study, we describe a potential intervention in the case of recurrent embryo implantation failure, which involves the non-invasive delivery of an early embryo back to the fertilization site using magnetically-controlled microrobots. As the embryo will be in contact with the secretory oviduct fluid, it can develop under natural conditions and in synchrony with the endometrium preparation. We discuss the potential microrobot designs, including a proper selection of materials and processes, envisioning their translation from bench to animal studies and human medicine. Finally, we highlight regulatory and ethical considerations for bringing this technology to the clinic.},

Village cultures, where multiple induced pluripotent stem lines are cultured and differentiated in a single dish, provide an elegant solution for scaling induced pluripotent stem experiments to the necessary sample sizes required for population-scale studies. Here, we show the utility of village models, demonstrating how cells can be assigned to an induced pluripotent stem line using single-cell sequencing and illustrating that the genetic, epigenetic or induced pluripotent stem line-specific effects explain a large percentage of gene expression variation for many genes. We demonstrate that village methods can effectively detect induced pluripotent stem line-specific effects, including sensitive dynamics of cell states.},

Candida albicans is the most prevalent fungal species of the human microbiota; this species asymptomatically colonizes many areas of the body, particularly the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts of healthy individuals. Alterations in host immunity, stress, resident microbiota, and other factors can lead to C. albicans overgrowth, causing a wide range of infections, from superficial mucosal to hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. To date, most studies of C. albicans have been carried out in suspension cultures; however, the medical impact of C. albicans (like that of many other microorganisms) depends on its ability to thrive as a biofilm, a closely packed community of cells. Biofilms are notorious for forming on implanted medical devices, including catheters, pacemakers, dentures, and prosthetic joints, which provide a surface and sanctuary for biofilm growth. C. albicans biofilms are intrinsically resistant to conventional antifungal therapeutics, the host immune system, and other environmental perturbations, making biofilm-based infections a significant clinical challenge. Here, we review our current knowledge of biofilms formed by C. albicans and closely related fungal species.},

However, their physical nature in living cells remains unclear (e.g., condensed domains or extended fiber loops; liquid-like or solid-like). Using novel approaches combining genomics, single-nucleosome imaging, and computational modeling, we investigated the physical organization and behavior of early DNA replicated regions in human cells, which correspond to Hi-C contact domains with active chromatin marks. Motion correlation analysis of two neighbor nucleosomes shows that nucleosomes form physically condensed domains with \textasciitilde 150-nm diameters, even in active chromatin regions. The mean-square displacement analysis between two neighbor nucleosomes demonstrates that nucleosomes behave like a liquid in the condensed domain on the \textasciitilde 150 nm/\textasciitilde 0.5 s spatiotemporal scale, which facilitates chromatin accessibility. Beyond the micrometers/minutes scale, chromatin seems solid-like, which may contribute to maintaining genome integrity. Our study reveals the viscoelastic principle of the chromatin polymer; chromatin is locally dynamic and reactive but globally stable.           ,              Active chromatin in human cells is rather condensed, but locally dynamic and reactive, and globally stable.},

Sch9 and CK2 kinases cooperatively regulate H3pT11 under stress conditions. Importantly, H3pT11 defective mutants prolonged chronological lifespan (CLS) by altering nutritional stress responses. Thus, the phosphorylation of H3T11 by Sch9 and CK2 links a nutritional stress response to chromatin in the regulation of CLS.}

Whereas the distribution of proteasomes and its role in synaptic function have been studied, whether proteasome activity regulates the axonal transport and metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), remains elusive. Using live imaging in primary hippocampal neurons, we showed that proteasome inhibition rapidly and severely impairs the axonal transport of APP. Fluorescent cross-correlation analyses and membrane internalization blockage showed that plasma membrane APP do not contribute to transport defects. Moreover, by western blots and double-color APP imaging we demonstrated that proteasome inhibition precludes APP axonal transport by enhancing its endo-lysosomal delivery where {$\beta$}cleavage is induced. Together, we found that proteasomes controls the distal transport of APP and can re-distribute Golgi-derived vesicles to the endo-lysosomal pathway. This crosstalk between proteasomes and lysosomes regulates APP intracellular dynamics, and defects in proteasome activity can be considered a contributing factor that lead to abnormal APP metabolism in AD.}

We find that mild muscle mitochondrial distress preserves mitochondrial function, impedes the agedependent deterioration of muscle function and architecture, and prolongs lifespan. Strikingly, this effect is mediated by at least two prolongevity compensatory signaling modules: one involving a muscle-restricted redox-dependent induction of genes that regulate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and another involving the transcriptional induction of the Drosophila ortholog of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, which systemically antagonizes insulin signaling and facilitates mitophagy. Given that several secreted IGFbinding proteins (IGFBPs) exist in mammals, our work raises the possibility that muscle mitochondrial injury in humans may similarly result in the secretion of IGFBPs, with important ramifications for diseases associated with aberrant insulin signaling.},

Strikingly, this effect is mediated by at least two prolongevity compensatory signaling modules: one involving a muscle-restricted redox-dependent induction of genes that regulate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and another involving the transcriptional induction of the Drosophila ortholog of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, which systemically antagonizes insulin signaling and facilitates mitophagy. Given that several secreted IGFbinding proteins (IGFBPs) exist in mammals, our work raises the possibility that muscle mitochondrial injury in humans may similarly result in the secretion of IGFBPs, with important ramifications for diseases associated with aberrant insulin signaling.},

  abstract = {Aging is an important risk factor for several human diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders, resulting from a combination of genetic and environmental factors (e.g., diet, smoking, obesity and stress), which, at molecular level, cause changes in gene expression underlying the decline of physiological function. Epigenetics, which include mechanisms regulating gene expression independently of changes to DNA sequence, regulate gene expression by modulating the structure of chromatin or by regulating the binding of transcriptional machinery to DNA. Several studies showed that an impairment of epigenetic mechanisms promotes alteration of gene expression underlying several aging-related diseases. Alteration of these mechanisms is also linked with changes of gene expression that occurs during aging processes of different tissues. In this review, we will outline the potential role of epigenetics in the onset of two age-related pathologies, cancer and cardiovascular diseases.}

  abstract = {Over the past decade, a growing number of studies have revealed that progressive changes to epigenetic information accompany aging in both dividing and nondividing cells. Functional studies in model organisms and humans indicate that epigenetic changes have a huge influence on the aging process. These epigenetic changes occur at various levels, including reduced bulk levels of the core histones, altered patterns of histone posttranslational modifications and DNA methylation, replacement of canonical histones with histone variants, and altered noncoding RNA expression, during both organismal aging and replicative senescence. The end result of epigenetic changes during aging is altered local accessibility to the genetic material, leading to aberrant gene expression, reactivation of transposable elements, and genomic instability. Strikingly, certain types of epigenetic information can function in a transgenerational manner to influence the life span of the offspring. Several important conclusions emerge from these studies: rather than being genetically predetermined, our life span is largely epigenetically determined; diet and other environmental influences can influence our life span by changing the epigenetic information; and inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes can influence life span of model organisms. These new findings provide better understanding of the mechanisms involved in aging. Given the reversible nature of epigenetic information, these studies highlight exciting avenues for therapeutic intervention in aging and age-associated diseases, including cancer.}

While deficits in this capacity in association with brain disease have serious functional consequences, little is known about individual differences in autobiographical memory (AM) in healthy individuals. Recently, healthy adults with highly superior autobiographical capacities have been identified (e.g., LePort, A.K., Mattfeld, A.T., Dickinson-Anson, H., Fallon, J. H., Stark, C.E., Kruggel, F., McGaugh, J.L., 2012. Behavioral and neuroanatomical investigation of Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM). Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 98(1), 78-- 92. doi: 10.1016/j. nlm.2012.05.002). Here we report data from three healthy, high functioning adults with the reverse pattern: lifelong severely deficient autobiographical memory (SDAM) with otherwise preserved cognitive function. Their self-reported selective inability to vividly recollect personally experienced events from a first-person perspective was corroborated by absence of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP) biomarkers associated with naturalistic and laboratory episodic recollection, as well as by behavioral evidence of impaired episodic retrieval, particularly for visual information. Yet learning and memory were otherwise intact, as long as these tasks could be accomplished by non-episodic processes. Thus these individuals function normally in day-to-day life, even though their past is experienced in the absence of recollection.}

Here, we tested the hypothesis that manipulating the intestinal microbiota influences the development of major comorbidities associated with aging and, in particular, inflammation affecting the brain and retina. Methods:\textbackslash hspace0.6em Using fecal microbiota transplantation, we exchanged the intestinal microbiota of young (3 months), old (18 months), and aged (24 months) mice. Whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing and metabolomics were used to develop a custom analysis workflow, to analyze the changes in gut microbiota composition and metabolic potential. Effects of age and microbiota transfer on the gut barrier, retina, and brain were assessed using protein assays, immunohistology, and behavioral testing. Results:\textbackslash hspace0.6em We show that microbiota composition profiles and key species enriched in young or aged mice are successfully transferred by FMT between young and aged mice and that FMT modulates resulting metabolic pathway profiles. The transfer of aged donor microbiota into young mice accelerates age-associated central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, retinal inflammation, and cytokine signaling and promotes loss of key functional protein in the eye, effects which are coincident with increased intestinal barrier permeability. Conversely, these detrimental effects can be reversed by the transfer of young donor microbiota. Conclusions:\textbackslash hspace0.6em These findings demonstrate that the aging gut microbiota drives detrimental changes in the gut-- brain and gut-- retina axes suggesting that microbial modulation may be of therapeutic benefit in preventing inflammationrelated tissue decline in later life.}

  abstract = {Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.},

In contrast, certain cancer cells exhibit methionine auxotrophy that can be exploited for therapeutic treatment, as decreasing dietary methionine selectively suppresses tumor growth. Thus, MetR represents an intervention that can extend lifespan with a complementary effect of delaying tumor growth. Beyond its function in protein synthesis, methionine feeds into complex metabolic pathways including the methionine cycle, the transsulfuration pathway, and polyamine biosynthesis. Manipulation of each of these branches extends lifespan; however, the interplay between MetR and these branches during regulation of lifespan is not well understood. In addition, a potential mechanism linking the activity of methionine metabolism and lifespan is regulation of production of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, which, after transferring its methyl group, is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine. Methylation regulates a wide range of processes, including those thought to be responsible for lifespan extension by MetR. Although the exact mechanisms of lifespan extension by MetR or methionine metabolism reprogramming are unknown, it may act via reducing the rate of translation, modifying gene expression, inducing a hormetic response, modulating autophagy, or inducing mitochondrial function, antioxidant defense, or other metabolic processes. Here, we review the mechanisms of lifespan extension by MetR and different branches of methionine metabolism in different species and the potential for exploiting the regulation of methyltransferases to delay aging.}

Here, we describe methodology for simultaneously predicting specific types of biomolecular interactions using high-throughput genomic data. This results in a comprehensive compendium of whole-genome networks for yeast, derived from ,3,500 experimental conditions and describing 30 interaction types, which range from general (e.g. physical or regulatory) to specific (e.g. phosphorylation or transcriptional regulation). We used these networks to investigate molecular pathways in carbon metabolism and cellular transport, proposing a novel connection between glycogen breakdown and glucose utilization supported by recent publications. Additionally, 14 specific predicted interactions in DNA topological change and protein biosynthesis were experimentally validated. We analyzed the systems-level network features within all interactomes, verifying the presence of small-world properties and enrichment for recurring network motifs. This compendium of physical, synthetic, regulatory, and functional interaction networks has been made publicly available through an interactive web interface for investigators to utilize in future research at http://function.princeton.edu/bioweaver/.}

  abstract = {Between the 1930s and 1960s, evolutionary geneticists worked out the basic principles of why organisms age. Despite much progress in the evolutionary biology of ageing since that time, however, many puzzles remain. The perhaps most fundamental of these is the question of which organisms should exhibit senescence and which should not (or which should age rapidly and which should not). The evolutionary origin of ageing from a non-senescent state has been conceptually framed, for example, in terms of the separation between germ-line and soma, the distinction between parents and their offspring, and--- in unicellular organisms--- the unequal distribution of cellular damage at cell division. These ideas seem to be closely related to the concept of `division of labour' between reproduction and somatic maintenance. Here, we review these concepts and develop a toy model to explore the importance of such asymmetries for the evolution of senescence. We apply our model to the simplest case of a multicellular system: an organism consisting of two totipotent cells. Notably, we find that in organisms which reproduce symmetrically and partition damage equally, senescence is still able to evolve, contrary to previous claims. Our results might have some bearing on understanding the origin of the germ-line-- soma separation and the evolution of senescence in multicellular organisms and in colonial species consisting of multiple types of individuals, such as, for example, eusocial insects with their different castes.

  abstract = {Although COVID-19 causes cardiac dysfunction in up to 25\% of patients, its pathogenesis remains unclear. Exposure of human iPSC-derived heart cells to SARS-CoV-2 revealed productive infection and robust transcriptomic and morphological signatures of damage, particularly in cardiomyocytes. Transcriptomic disruption of structural proteins corroborated adverse morphologic features, which included a distinct pattern of myofibrillar fragmentation and numerous iPSC-cardiomyocytes lacking nuclear DNA. Human autopsy specimens from COVID19 patients displayed similar sarcomeric disruption, as well as cardiomyocytes without DNA staining. These striking cytopathic features provide new insights into SARS-CoV-2 induced cardiac damage, offer a platform for discovery of potential therapeutics, and raise serious concerns about the long-term consequences of COVID-19.}

  abstract = {Aging is a complex, multifaceted process that induces a myriad of physiological changes over an extended period of time. Aging is accompanied by major biochemical and biomechanical changes at macroscopic and microscopic length scales that affect not only tissues and organs but also cells and subcellular organelles. These changes include transcriptional and epigenetic modifications; changes in energy production within mitochondria; and alterations in the overall mechanics of cells, their nuclei, and their surrounding extracellular matrix. In addition, aging influences the ability of cells to sense changes in extracellular-matrix compliance (mechanosensation) and to transduce these changes into biochemical signals (mechanotransduction). Moreover, following a complex positive-feedback loop, aging is accompanied by changes in the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, resulting in changes in the mechanics of connective tissues in older individuals. Consequently, these progressive dysfunctions facilitate many human pathologies and deficits that are associated with aging, including cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurodegenerative disorders and diseases. Here, we critically review recent work highlighting some of the primary biophysical changes occurring in cells and tissues that accompany the aging process.}

However, whether NAD+ depletion occurs in patients with degenerative disorders and whether NAD+ repletion improves their symptoms has remained open. Here, we report systemic NAD+ deficiency in adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy patients. We administered an increasing dose of NAD+booster niacin, a vitamin B3 form (to 750-- 1,000 mg/day; clinicaltrials.gov NCT03973203) for patients and their matched controls for 10 or 4 months, respectively. Blood NAD+ increased in all subjects, up to 8-fold, and muscle NAD+ of patients reached the level of their controls. Some patients showed anemia tendency, while muscle strength and mitochondrial biogenesis increased in all subjects. In patients, muscle metabolome shifted toward controls and liver fat decreased even 50\%. Our evidence indicates that blood analysis is useful in identifying NAD+ deficiency and points niacin to be an efficient NAD+ booster for treating mitochondrial myopathy.}

Their revolutionary discovery in a metallic alloy, less than three decades ago, has required a full reconsideration of what we defined as a crystal structure. Surprisingly, quasi-crystalline structures have been discovered also at much larger length scales in different microscopic systems for which the size of elementary building blocks ranges between the nanometric to the micrometric scale. Here, we report the first experimental observation of spontaneous quasi-crystal self-assembly at the millimetric scale. This result is obtained in a fully athermal system of macroscopic spherical grains vibrated on a substrate. Starting from a liquid-like disordered phase, the grains begin to locally arrange into three types of squared and triangular tiles that eventually align, forming 8-fold symmetric quasi-crystal that has been predicted in simulation but not yet observed experimentally in non-atomic systems. These results are not only the proof of a novel route to spontaneously assemble quasi-crystals but are of fundamental interest for the connection between equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics.},

  abstract = {Many diseases appear to be caused by the misregulation of protein maintenance. Such diseases of protein homeostasis, or ``proteostasis,'' include loss-of-function diseases (cystic fibrosis) and gain-of-toxic-function diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease). Proteostasis is maintained by the proteostasis network, which comprises pathways that control protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, aggregation, disaggregation, and degradation. The decreased ability of the proteostasis network to cope with inherited misfolding-prone proteins, aging, and/or metabolic/environmental stress appears to trigger or exacerbate proteostasis diseases. Herein, we review recent evidence supporting the principle that proteostasis is influenced both by an adjustable proteostasis network capacity and protein folding energetics, which together determine the balance between folding efficiency, misfolding, protein degradation, and aggregation. We review how small molecules can enhance proteostasis by binding to and stabilizing specific proteins (pharmacologic chaperones) or by increasing the proteostasis network capacity (proteostasis regulators). We propose that such therapeutic strategies, including combination therapies, represent a new approach for treating a range of diverse human maladies.}

We set out to address the fundamental question of how gut microbes and nutrition, key regulators of host physiology, affect the effects of metformin. Combining two tractable genetic models, the bacterium E. coli and the nematode C. elegans, we developed a highthroughput four-way screen to define the underlying host-microbe-drug-nutrient interactions. We show that microbes integrate cues from metformin and the diet through the phosphotransferase signaling pathway that converges on the transcriptional regulator Crp. A detailed experimental characterization of metformin effects downstream of Crp in combination with metabolic modeling of the microbiota in metformin-treated type 2 diabetic patients predicts the production of microbial agmatine, a regulator of metformin effects on host lipid metabolism and lifespan. Our high-throughput screening platform paves the way for identifying exploitable drug-nutrient-microbiome interactions to improve host health and longevity through targeted microbiome therapies.}

Previous studies have reported downregulation of CREB-mediated transcription by oxidative stress and Ab. The promoter for CREB itself contains cyclic AMP response elements. Therefore, we examined the expression of CREB in the hippocampal neurons of Tg2576 mice, AD post-mortem brain and in cultured rat hippocampal neurons exposed to Ab aggregates. Results: Laser Capture Microdissection of hippocampal neurons from Tg2576 mouse brain revealed decreases in the mRNA levels of CREB and its target, BDNF. Immunohistochemical analysis of Tg2576 mouse brain showed decreases in CREB levels in hippocampus and cortex. Markers of oxidative stress were detected in transgenic mouse brain and decreased CREB staining was observed in regions showing abundance of astrocytes. There was also an inverse correlation between SDS-extracted Ab and CREB protein levels in Alzheimer's post-mortem hippocampal samples. The levels of CREB-regulated BDNF and BIRC3, a caspase inhibitor, decreased and the active cleaved form of caspase-9, a marker for the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, was elevated in these samples. Exposure of rat primary hippocampal neurons to Ab fibrils decreased CREB promoter activity. Decrease in CREB mRNA levels in Ab-treated neurons was reversed by the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine. Overexpression of CREB by adenoviral transduction led to significant protection against Ab-induced neuronal apoptosis. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that chronic downregulation of CREB-mediated transcription results in decrease of CREB content in the hippocampal neurons of AD brain which may contribute to exacerbation of disease progression.}

We introduce Three-Dimensional Flexible Refinement (3DFlex), a motion-based neural network model for continuous molecular heterogeneity for cryo-EM data. 3DFlex exploits knowledge that conformational variability of a protein is often the result of physical processes that transport density over space and tend to preserve local geometry. From two-dimensional image data, 3DFlex enables the determination of high-resolution 3D density, and provides an explicit model of a flexible protein's motion over its conformational landscape. Experimentally, for large molecular machines (tri-snRNP spliceosome complex, translocating ribosome) and small flexible proteins (TRPV1 ion channel,               {$\alpha$}               V               {$\beta$}               8 integrin, SARS-CoV-2 spike), 3DFlex learns nonrigid molecular motions while resolving details of moving secondary structure elements. 3DFlex can improve 3D density resolution beyond the limits of existing methods because particle images contribute coherent signal over the conformational landscape.},

Over the last 2 years, we have generated 1840 new families and increased coverage of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) to nearly 80\%. Notably, we have taken the step of opening up the annotation of our families to the Wikipedia community, by linking Pfam families to relevant Wikipedia pages and encouraging the Pfam and Wikipedia communities to improve and expand those pages. We continue to improve the Pfam website and add new visualizations, such as the `sunburst' representation of taxonomic distribution of families. In this work we additionally address two topics that will be of particular interest to the Pfam community. First, we explain the definition and use of family-specific, manually curated gathering thresholds. Second, we discuss some of the features of domains of unknown function (also known as DUFs), which constitute a rapidly growing class of families within Pfam.}

In this study, we designed a modular ensemble of 21 deep neural networks (DNNs) of varying depth, structure and optimization to predict human chronological age using a basic blood test. To train the DNNs, we used over 60,000 samples from common blood biochemistry and cell count tests from routine health exams performed by a single laboratory and linked to chronological age and sex. The best performing DNN in the ensemble demonstrated 81.5 \% epsilon-accuracy r = 0.90 with R2 = 0.80 and MAE = 6.07 years in predicting chronological age within a 10 year frame, while the entire ensemble achieved 83.5\% epsilon-accuracy r = 0.91 with R2 = 0.82 and MAE = 5.55 years. The ensemble also identified the 5 most important markers for predicting human chronological age: albumin, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, urea and erythrocytes. To allow for public testing and evaluate real-life performance of the predictor, we developed an online system available at http://www.aging.ai. The ensemble approach may facilitate integration of multi-modal data linked to chronological age and sex that may lead to simple, minimally invasive, and affordable methods of tracking integrated biomarkers of aging in humans and performing cross-species feature importance analysis.}

The aim was to determine patterns of mortality and associated factors, with a special focus on Vitamin D status. Results revealed that majority of the death cases were male and older and had pre-existing condition and below normal Vitamin D serum level. Univariate analysis revealed that older and male cases with pre-existing condition and below normal Vitamin D levels were associated with increasing odds of death.

We observed the rapid evolution of clustering genotypes that display a novel multicellular life history characterized by reproduction via multicellular propagules, a juvenile phase, and determinate growth. The multicellular clusters are uniclonal, minimizing within-cluster genetic conflicts of interest. Simple among-cell division of labor rapidly evolved. Early multicellular strains were composed of physiologically similar cells, but these subsequently evolved higher rates of programmed cell death (apoptosis), an adaptation that increases propagule production. These results show that key aspects of multicellular complexity, a subject of central importance to biology, can readily evolve from unicellular eukaryotes.},

Recently, however, it has become apparent that this process entails more than a simple cessation of cell growth. In addition to suppressing tumorigenesis, cellular senescence might also promote tissue repair and fuel inflammation associated with aging and cancer progression. Thus, cellular senescence might participate in four complex biological processes (tumor suppression, tumor promotion, aging, and tissue repair), some of which have apparently opposing effects. The challenge now is to understand the senescence response well enough to harness its benefits while suppressing its drawbacks.}

Here, we provide bioinformatic evidence of dysregulation of mitochondrial and proteostasis pathways in muscle aging and diseases. Moreover, we show accumulation of amyloid-like deposits and mitochondrial dysfunction during natural aging in the body wall muscle of C. elegans, in human primary myotubes, and in mouse skeletal muscle, partially phenocopying inclusion body myositis (IBM). Importantly, NAD+ homeostasis is critical to control age-associated muscle amyloidosis. Treatment of either aged N2 worms, a nematode model of amyloid-beta muscle proteotoxicity, human aged myotubes, or old mice with the NAD+ boosters nicotinamide riboside (NR) and olaparib (AZD) increases mitochondrial function and muscle homeostasis while attenuating amyloid accumulation. Hence, our data reveal that age-related amyloidosis is a contributing factor to mitochondrial dysfunction and that both are features of the aging muscle that can be ameliorated by NAD+ metabolism-enhancing approaches, warranting further clinical studies.}

Though it is widely believed that long life runs in families for genetic reasons, estimates of life span ``heritability'' are consistently low ( 15-- 30\%). Here, we used pedigree data from Ancestry public trees, including hundreds of millions of historical persons, to estimate the heritability of human longevity. Although ``nominal heritability'' estimates based on correlations among genetic relatives agreed with prior literature, the majority of that correlation was also captured by correlations among nongenetic (in-law) relatives, suggestive of highly assortative mating around life span-influencing factors (genetic and/or environmental). We used structural equation modeling to account for assortative mating, and concluded that the true heritability of human longevity for birth cohorts across the 1800s and early 1900s was well below 10\%, and that it has been generally overestimated due to the effect of assortative mating.}

Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae over the past 20 years have found a connection between the ribosomal RNA gene cluster (rDNA) and lifespan [2]. The highly repetitive rDNA exhibits genomic instability, and the antiaging histone deacetylase gene SIR2 regulates this instability. We previously proposed that SIR2 governs lifespan by repressing rDNA noncoding transcription and rDNA instability, but the extent to which lifespan is affected by SIR2 acting at the rDNA versus other genomic regions, and the relationship between rDNA noncoding transcription/ rDNA stability and lifespan have remained controversial. To control rDNA noncoding transcription and rDNA instability, we use a strain in which the rDNA noncoding promoter is replaced with an inducible promoter. Here, we show that repression of noncoding transcription extends lifespan and makes SIR2 dispensable for lifespan extension. These results indicate that Sir2 maintains lifespan through repression of E-pro noncoding transcription in the rDNA cluster, rather than pleiotropically at other loci. The observation of rDNA instability in other organisms, including humans, suggests that this may be a conserved aging pathway.},

  abstract = {Significance Cells and organisms grow old and die. We develop a biophysical model of the mechanism. Young cells are kept healthy by the positive processes of protein synthesis, degradation, and chaperoning (the activity of keeping proteins properly folded). But, with age, negative processes increase: Oxidative damage accumulates randomly in the cell's proteins, healthy synthesis and degradation slow down, and--- like overfilled garbage cans--- chaperone capacity is exceeded. The chaperones are distracted trying to fold irreversibly damaged proteins, leading to accumulating misfolded and aggregated proteins in the cell. The tipping point to death happens when the negative overwhelms the positive. The model makes several quantitative predictions of the life span of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans . , What molecular processes drive cell aging and death? Here, we model how proteostasis--- i.e., the folding, chaperoning, and maintenance of protein function--- collapses with age from slowed translation and cumulative oxidative damage. Irreparably damaged proteins accumulate with age, increasingly distracting the chaperones from folding the healthy proteins the cell needs. The tipping point to death occurs when replenishing good proteins no longer keeps up with depletion from misfolding, aggregation, and damage. The model agrees with experiments in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans that show the following: Life span shortens nonlinearly with increased temperature or added oxidant concentration, and life span increases in mutants having more chaperones or proteasomes. It predicts observed increases in cellular oxidative damage with age and provides a mechanism for the Gompertz-like rise in mortality observed in humans and other organisms. Overall, the model shows how the instability of proteins sets the rate at which damage accumulates with age and upends a cell's normal proteostasis balance.}

  abstract = {Background and Purpose--- The phrase ``time is brain'' emphasizes that human nervous tissue is rapidly lost as stroke progresses and emergent evaluation and therapy are required. Recent advances in quantitative neurostereology and stroke neuroimaging permit calculation of just how much brain is lost per unit time in acute ischemic stroke. Methods--- Systematic literature-review identified consensus estimates of number of neurons, synapses, and myelinated fibers in the human forebrain; volume of large vessel, supratentorial ischemic stroke; and interval from onset to completion of large vessel, supratentorial ischemic stroke. Results--- The typical final volume of large vessel, supratentorial ischemic stroke is 54 mL (varied in sensitivity analysis from 19 to 100 mL). The average duration of nonlacunar stroke evolution is 10 hours (range 6 to 18 hours), and the average number of neurons in the human forebrain is 22 billion. In patients experiencing a typical large vessel acute ischemic stroke, 120 million neurons, 830 billion synapses, and 714 km (447 miles) of myelinated fibers are lost each hour. In each minute, 1.9 million neurons, 14 billion synapses, and 12 km (7.5 miles) of myelinated fibers are destroyed. Compared with the normal rate of neuron loss in brain aging, the ischemic brain ages 3.6 years each hour without treatment. Altering single input variables in sensitivity analyses modestly affected the estimated point values but not order of magnitude. Conclusions--- Quantitative estimates of the pace of neural circuitry loss in human ischemic stroke emphasize the time urgency of stroke care. The typical patient loses 1.9 million neurons each minute in which stroke is untreated. (Stroke. 2006;37:263-266.)}

  abstract = {Aging is the single greatest cause of disease and death worldwide, and so understanding the associated processes could vastly improve quality of life. While the field has identified major categories of aging damage such as altered intercellular communication, loss of proteostasis, and eroded mitochondrial function 1 , these deleterious processes interact with extraordinary complexity within and between organs. Yet, a comprehensive analysis of aging dynamics organism-wide is lacking. Here we performed RNA-sequencing of 17 organs and plasma proteomics at 10 ages across the mouse lifespan. We uncover previously unknown linear and non-linear expression shifts during aging, which cluster in strikingly consistent trajectory groups with coherent biological functions, including extracellular matrix regulation, unfolded protein binding, mitochondrial function, and inflammatory and immune response. Remarkably, these gene sets are expressed similarly across tissues, differing merely in age of onset and amplitude. Especially pronounced is widespread immune cell activation, detectable first in white adipose depots in middle age. Single-cell RNA-sequencing confirms the accumulation of adipose T and B cells, including immunoglobulin J-expressing plasma cells, which also accrue concurrently across diverse organs. Finally, we show how expression shifts in distinct tissues are highly correlated with corresponding protein levels in plasma, thus potentially contributing to aging of the systemic circulation. Together, these data demonstrate a similar yet asynchronous inter- and intra-organ progression of aging, thereby providing a foundation to track systemic sources of declining health at old age.}

Our approach is based on a coordinate ascent method which naturally preserves the sparsity of the network structure. We show that SINCO is often comparable to, and, in various cases, outperforms commonly used approaches such as glasso [7] and COVSEL [1], in terms of both structure-reconstruction error (particularly, false positive error) and computational time. Moreover, our method has the advantage of being easily parallelizable. Finally, we show that SINCO's greedy nature allows reproduction of the regularization path behavior by applying the method to one (sufficiently small) instance of the regularization parameter {$\lambda$} only; thus, SINCO can obtain a desired number of network links directly, without having to tune the {$\lambda$} parameter. We evaluate our method empirically on various simulated networks and real-life data from biological and neuroimaging applications.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the toxicological and pharmacokinetic properties of sucralose-6-acetate, a structural analog of the artificial sweetener sucralose. Sucralose-6acetate is an intermediate and impurity in the manufacture of sucralose, and recent com\- mercial sucralose samples were found to contain up to 0.67\% sucralose-6-acetate. Studies in a rodent model found that sucralose-6-acetate is also present in fecal samples with levels up to 10\% relative to sucralose which suggest that sucralose is also acetylated in the intestines. A MultiFlow\textregistered{} assay, a high-throughput genotoxicity screening tool, and a micronucleus (MN) test that detects cytogenetic damage both indicated that sucralose-6-acetate is genotoxic. The mechanism of action was classified as clastogenic (produces DNA strand breaks) using the MultiFlow\textregistered{} assay. The amount of sucralose-6-acetate in a single daily sucralose-sweetened drink might far exceed the threshold of toxicological concern for genotoxicity (TTCgenotox) of 0.15 \textmu g/person/day. The RepliGut\textregistered{} System was employed to expose human intestinal epithe\- lium to sucralose-6-acetate and sucralose, and an RNA-seq analysis was performed to deter\- mine gene expression induced by these exposures. Sucralose-6-acetate significantly increased the expression of genes associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and cancer with greatest expression for the metallothionein 1 G gene (MT1G). Measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability in human transverse colon epithelium indicated that sucralose-6-acetate and sucralose both impaired intestinal barrier integrity. Sucralose-6acetate also inhibited two members of the cytochrome P450 family (CYP1A2 and CYP2C19). Overall, the toxicological and pharmacokinetic findings for sucralose-6-acetate raise significant health concerns regarding the safety and regulatory status of sucralose itself.},

Although confirmed by a multitude of experimental methods for various systems, its mechanism remained unclear. A simulation technique is introduced that yields accurate pressures between solvated surfaces at prescribed water chemical potential and is applied to a stack of phospholipid bilayers. Experimental pressure data are quantitatively reproduced and the simulations unveil a rich microscopic picture: Direct membrane--membrane interactions are attractive but overwhelmed by repulsive indirect water contributions. Below about 17 water molecules per lipid, this indirect repulsion is of an energetic nature and due to desorption of hydration water; for larger hydration it is entropic and suggested to involve water depolarization. This antagonistic nature and the presence of various compensating contributions indicate that the hydration repulsion is less universal than previously assumed and rather involves finely tuned surface-water interactions.},

We detect interactors of the mitochondrial receptor for cytosolic ribosomes, of prohibitin scaffolds and of respiratory complexes. The identification of quality-control factors operating at the mitochondrial protein entry gate reveals pathways for preprotein ubiquitylation, deubiquitylation and degradation. Interactions between the peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase Pth2 and the entry gate led to the elucidation of a constitutive pathway for the removal of preproteins.

We measured nineteen blood biomarkers that include constituents of standard hematological measures, lipid biomarkers, and markers of inflammation and frailty in 4704 participants of the Long Life Family Study (LLFS), age range 30-- 110 years, and used an agglomerative algorithm to group LLFS participants into clusters thus yielding 26 different biomarker signatures. To test whether these signatures were associated with differences in biological aging, we correlated them with longitudinal changes in physiological functions and incident risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and mortality using longitudinal data collected in the LLFS. Signature 2 was associated with significantly lower mortality, morbidity, and better physical function relative to the most common biomarker signature in LLFS, while nine other signatures were associated with less successful aging, characterized by higher risks for frailty, morbidity, and mortality. The predictive values of seven signatures were replicated in an independent data set from the Framingham Heart Study with comparable significant effects, and an additional three signatures showed consistent effects. This analysis shows that various biomarker signatures exist, and their significant associations with physical function, morbidity, and mortality suggest that these patterns represent differences in biological aging. The signatures show that dysregulation of a single biomarker can change with patterns of other biomarkers, and age-related changes of individual biomarkers alone do not necessarily indicate disease or functional decline.}

  abstract = {Adult skeletal muscle regeneration relies on the activity of satellite cells residing in the skeletal muscle niche. However, systemic and intrinsic factors decrease the myogenic differentiation potential of satellite cells thereby impairing muscle regeneration. Here we present data showing that late passage C2C12 myoblasts exhibited significantly impaired myogenic differentiation potential that was accompanied by impaired expression of myogenic regulatory factors (Myf5, MyoD, Myogenin, and MRF4) and members of myocyte enhancer factor 2 family. Notably, ectopic expression of NANOG preserved the morphology and restored the myogenic differentiation capacity of late passage myoblasts, possibly by restoring the expression level of these myogenic factors. Muscle regeneration was effective in 2D cultures and in 3D skeletal microtissues mimicking the skeletal muscle niche. The presence of NANOG was required for at least 15 days to reverse the impaired differentiation potential of myoblasts. However, it was critical to remove NANOG during the process of maturation, as it inhibited myotube formation. Finally, myoblasts that were primed by NANOG maintained their differentiation capacity for 20 days after NANOG withdrawal, suggesting potential epigenetic changes. In conclusion, these results shed light on the potential of NANOG to restore the myogenic differentiation potential of myoblasts, which is impaired after multiple rounds of cellular division, and to reverse the loss of muscle regeneration.}

  abstract = {Leaf senescence is a programmed developmental process governed by various endogenous and exogenous factors, such as the plant developmental stage, leaf age, phytohormone levels, darkness, and exposure to stresses. It was found that, in addition to its well-documented role in the enhancement of plant frost tolerance, overexpression of the C-repeat/dehydration responsive element binding factor 2 (CBF2) gene in Arabidopsis delayed the onset of leaf senescence and extended the life span of the plants by approximately 2 weeks. This phenomenon was exhibited both during developmental leaf senescence and during senescence of detached leaves artificially induced by either darkness or phytohormones. Transcriptome analysis using the Affymetrix ATH1 genome array revealed that overexpression of CBF2 significantly influenced the expression of 286 genes in mature leaf tissue. In addition to 30 stress-related genes, overexpression of CBF2 also affected the expression of 24 transcription factor (TF) genes, and 20 genes involved in protein metabolism, degradation, and post-translational modification. These results indicate that overexpression of CBF2 not only increases frost tolerance, but also affects other developmental processes, most likely through interactions with additional TFs and protein modification genes. The present findings shed new light on the crucial relationship between plant stress tolerance and longevity, as reported for other eukaryotic organisms.}

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading throughout the world. Recent reports suggest that 1030\% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are asymptomatic. Other studies report that some subjects have significant viral shedding prior to symptom onset. Since both asymptomatic and presymptomatic subjects can spread the disease, identifying such individuals is critical for effective control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities in order to also screen asymptomatic carriers. In fact, such tests will be routinely required until a vaccine is developed. Yet, a major bottleneck of managing the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries is diagnostic testing, due to limited laboratory capabilities as well as limited access to genome-extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) reagents. We developed P-BEST - a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing, using a non-adaptive grouptesting approach, which significantly reduces the number of tests required to identify all positive subjects within a large set of samples. Instead of testing each sample separately, samples are pooled into groups and each pool is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the standard clinically approved PCRbased diagnostic assay. Each sample is part of multiple pools, using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing designed for maximizing the ability to identify all positive individuals. We evaluated P-BEST using leftover samples that were previously clinically tested for COVID-19. In our current proof-of-concept study we pooled 384 patient samples into 48 pools providing an 8-fold increase in testing efficiency. Five sets of 384 samples, containing 1-5 positive carriers were screened and all positive carriers in each set were correctly identified. P-BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that will work with any clinically approved genome-extraction and PCR-based diagnostic methodologies.}

  abstract = {Long-lived mutants provide unique insights into the genetic factors that limit lifespan in wild-type animals. Most mutants and RNA interference targets found to extend life, typically by 1.5- to 2.5-fold, were discovered in C. elegans. Several longevity-assurance pathways are conserved across widely divergent taxa, indicating that mechanisms of lifespan regulation evolved several hundred million years ago. Strong mutations to the C. elegans gene encoding AGE-1/PI3KCS achieve unprecedented longevity by orchestrating the modulation (predominantly silencing) of multiple signaling pathways. This is evident in a profound attenuation of total kinase activity, leading to reduced phosphoprotein content. Mutations to the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) have the potential to modulate all enzymes that depend on its product, PIP3, for membrane tethering or activation by other kinases. Remarkably, strong mutants inactivating PI3K also silence multiple signaling pathways at the transcript level, partially but not entirely mediated by the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. Mammals have a relatively large proportion of somatic cells, and survival depends on their replication, whereas somatic cell divisions in nematodes are limited to development and reproductive tissues. Thus, translation of longevity gains from nematodes to mammals requires disentangling the downstream consequences of signaling mutations, to avoid their deleterious consequences.}

This animal model exhibits all traits of metabolic syndrome and has a remarkably reduced lifespan (1.5 years as compared to 3 years in parental WNIN rats), albeit, the factors associated with premature aging are not well understood. Considering that oxidative stress and DNA damage are crucial players associated with senescence, we analyzed oxidative stress markers like lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation; DNA damage in terms of both single-stranded and double-stranded breaks and the activity of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase and catalase in brain regions of these animals. Our study revealed that the magnitude of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the neocortex and hippocampus of 3-month-old WNIN/Ob obese rats is as high as that seen in 15-month-old parental WNIN control rats. Concurrently, the antioxidant enzyme activity was significantly decreased. From these results, it can be concluded that increased oxidative stress-induced damage of macromolecules, probably due to reduced activity of antioxidant enzymes, is associated with premature aging in WNIN/Ob obese rats. \'O 2014 IBRO.

Here, we report the discovery of three senolytics using cost-effective machine learning algorithms trained solely on published data. We computationally screened various chemical libraries and validated the senolytic action of ginkgetin, periplocin and oleandrin in human cell lines under various modalities of senescence. The compounds have potency comparable to known senolytics, and we show that oleandrin has improved potency over its target as compared to best-in-class alternatives. Our approach led to several hundred-fold reduction in drug screening costs and demonstrates that artificial intelligence can take maximum advantage of small and heterogeneous drug screening data, paving the way for new open science approaches to early-stage drug discovery.},

Phonon microscopy detects BLS from laser generated coherent phonon fields to offer an attractive route for imaging since, at GHz frequencies, the phonon wavelength is sub-optical. Using phonon fields to image single cells is challenging as the signal to noise ratio and acquisition time are often poor. However, recent advances in the instrumentation have enabled imaging of fixed and living cells. This work presents the first experimental characterisation of phonon-based axial resolution provided by the response to a sharp edge. The obtained axial resolution is up to 10 times higher than that of the optical system used to take the measurements. Validation of the results are obtained with various polymer objects, which are in good agreement with those obtained using atomic force microscopy. Edge localisation, and hence profilometry, of a phantom boundary is measured with accuracy and precision of approximately 60 nm and 100 nm respectively. Finally, 3D imaging of fixed cells in culture medium is demonstrated.},

Our findings indicate a mechanism for regulating molecular pathways of aging that prevents the development of metabolic abnormalities associated with unhealthy dieting.

CR-induced transcriptional reprogramming in adipose tissue implicated pathways regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, anti-inflammatory responses, and longevity. Expression of the gene Pla2g7 encoding platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PLA2G7) is inhibited in humans undergoing CR. Deletion of Pla2g7 in mice showed decreased thymic lipoatrophy, protection against age-related inflammation, lowered NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and improved metabolic health. Therefore, the reduction of PLA2G7 may mediate the immunometabolic effects of CR and could potentially be harnessed to lower inflammation and extend the health span. , Searching for caloric restriction mimetics Moderately decreased food intake that does not cause malnutrition (caloric restriction) has beneficial effects on health span and life span in model organisms. Spadaro et al . examined measures of immune function in humans who restricted caloric intake by about 14\% over 2 years and in mice under a more severe 40\% restriction (see the Perspective by Rhoads and Anderson). Cellular analyses and transcriptional surveys showed marks of improved thymic function under caloric restriction. Expression of the gene encoding platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase ( PLA2G7 ) was decreased in humans undergoing caloric restriction. Inactivation of the gene in mice decreased inflammation and improved markers of thymic function and some metabolic functions in aging mice. Thus, decreased expression of PLA2G7 might mediate some beneficial effects of caloric restriction. --- LBR , A gene knockout in mice partially mimics the benefits of caloric restriction observed in humans.}

Conventional testing for SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in universal transport medium (UTM), extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). As testing has scaled across the world, supply chain challenges have emerged across this entire workflow. Here we sought to evaluate how eliminating the UTM storage and RNA extraction steps would impact the results of molecular testing. Using paired mid-turbinate swabs self-collected by 11 individuals with previously established SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we performed a comparison of conventional (swab {$\rightarrow$} UTM {$\rightarrow$} RNA extraction {$\rightarrow$} RT-qPCR) vs. simplified (direct elution from dry swab {$\rightarrow$} RT-qPCR) protocols. Our results suggest that dry swabs eluted directly into a simple buffered solution (TE) can support molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 via endpoint RT-qPCR without substantially compromising sensitivity. Although further confirmation with a larger sample size and variation of other parameters is necessary, these results are encouraging for the possibility of a simplified workflow that could support massively scaled testing for COVID-19 control.}

We present three lines of evidence supporting the biological importance of the uncovered transcriptome imbalance. First, in vertebrates the length association primarily displays a lower relative abundance of long transcripts in aging. Second, eight antiaging interventions of the Interventions Testing Program of the National Institute on Aging can counter this length association. Third, we find that in humans and mice the genes with the longest transcripts enrich for genes reported to extend lifespan, whereas those with the shortest transcripts enrich for genes reported to shorten lifespan.

Freeze-tolerant animals include various terrestrially hibernating amphibians and reptiles, many species of insects, and numerous other invertebrates inhabiting both terrestrial and intertidal environments. Wellknown strategies of freezing survival include accumulation of low molecular mass carbohydrate cryoprotectants (e.g., glycerol), use of ice nucleating agents/proteins for controlled triggering of ice growth and of antifreeze proteins that inhibit ice recrystallization, and good tolerance of anoxia and dehydration. The present article focuses on more recent advances in our knowledge of the genes and proteins that support freeze tolerance and the metabolic regulatory mechanisms involved. Important roles have been identified for aquaporins and transmembrane channels that move cryoprotectants, heat shock proteins and other chaperones, antioxidant defenses, and metabolic rate depression. Genome and proteome screening has revealed many new potential targets that respond to freezing, in particular implicating cytoskeleton remodeling as a necessary facet of low temperature and/or cell volume adaptation. Key regulatory mechanisms include reversible phosphorylation control of metabolic enzymes and microRNA control of gene transcript expression. These help to remodel metabolism to preserve core functions while suppressing energy expensive metabolic activities such as the cell cycle.

  abstract = {Much research in comparative biochemistry is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow organisms to adapt to and survive diverse environmental challenges. In recent years, genomic and proteomic approaches have been key drivers of advancement in the field, for example, providing knowledge about gene and protein expression, regulation of signal transduction pathways, and functional control of enzymes/proteins by reversible protein phosphorylation. Advances in comparative biochemistry have always drawn upon conceptual and technological advances that arise from ``mainline'' biochemistry and molecular biology, often from medical models. The present article discusses three such advances that will have major impacts on comparative biochemistry in the 21st century. The first is the crucial role of posttranslational modification in metabolic control, expanding outwards from reversible phosphorylation to explore the individual and interacting effects of protein modification by acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation and O-GlcNAcylation, among others. The second is the newly recognized role of non-coding RNA in the regulation of gene expression, particularly the action of microRNAs. The third is the emergence of powerful multiplex technology that allows rapid, high-throughput detection of analytes and will revolutionize RNA and protein profiling in the comparative biochemistry laboratory. Commercial tools such as Luminex allow researchers to simultaneously quantify up to 100 different analytes in a single sample, thereby creating broad functional analyses of metabolism and cell signaling pathways.},

It is unknown if these expansions represent increased viral reactivation or simply reflect an accumulation over time. We investigated herpesvirus reactivation in young and old subjects co-infected with CMV and EBV. Using molecular and serological techniques, we found significant increases in both the frequency and magnitude of EBV and CMV reactivation in elderly subjects. CMV DNA was frequently detected in the urine of elderly subjects; EBV load in peripheral blood was also significantly increased. Notably, EBV DNA in plasma was detected in a majority of the elderly subjects which was supported by frequent transcription of late structural genes. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells specific for EBV structural antigens were detected in samples from the elderly. Samples from our younger control group were negative for EBV DNA in plasma, CMV DNA in urine, expression of structural transcripts, and lacked CD8+ T cells specific for EBV structural antigens. These findings indicate that the aged immune system is no longer able to control EBV and CMV reactivation that could now be characterized as chronic instead of latent.}

  abstract = {The origins of aging of higher forms of life, particularly humans, is presented as the consequence of an evolved balance between 4 specific kinds of dysfunctionproducing events and 4 kinds of evolved counteracting effects in long-lived forms. Among the deleterious events, particular importance is assigned to damage to DNA, but damage of a different kind than classical mutations. The evolution in man's ancestors of means to counteract the kinds of events that limit the life-spans of short lived mammals is postulated to be the indirect consequence of the prior evolution of superior mental capacities. Further, it is shown that the human species rapidly evolved its life-extending mutations because of the special circumstances afforded by the subdivision of the species into small semi-isolated (genetically) tribes of 10-100 individuals in which polygamy was the key factor in rapid incorporation of life- and well-being-extending new features. These conditions permit at least one or two orders of magnitude more of such beneficial genes to have been incorporated into our genomes during the 100,000 years or so of extremely rapid human evolution that evidently occurred about 100,000 to 200,000 years age than has been posited by other workers. The sources of damage to DNA are then considered, with special emphasis on free-radical derivatives of molecular oxygen and evidence is presented that longer lived forms of mammals have peroxide lysing enzymes that produce a lower steady state of damaging radicals derived from this compound. Evidence that so-called "classical" mutations cannot be the source of aging is then reviewed. A different kind of mutation, one that is not increased in proportion to point mutations by mutagens, namely deletion of tandemly duplicated copies of genes, is discussed and the evidence that such damage (gene loss) occurs in an amount sufficient to account for the major losses in function during aging is presented. The most likely mechanisms of such loss plus the prospects for evolving and bio-engineering means to counteract these losses together with some implications regarding the documented loss of of NORs with age (as regards rDNA loss) together with key areas for intensive present and future research on aging are presented.}

This report describes an investigation on the nature of the two corresponding structures and the segment responsible for forming the slower mobility band. Sedimentation equilibrium of the 79-nt RNA was consistent with the two gel bands corresponding to monomer and dimer forms. The portion of the RNA required for dimer formation was explored using a secondary structure prediction algorithm of two 79-nt RNAs linked in a head-to-tail fashion. The predicted structure suggested that the first 21-nt at the 59 end of each RNA formed a selfcomplementary duplex. A ribonuclease H assay carried out with RNA prepared as monomer (M), or a mixture of monomer and dimer (M/D), gave results consistent with the predicted M and D structures. Gel mobility experiments on 59 and 39 segments of the 79-nt RNA also indicated that dimer formation was due to the 21-nt 59 end. Studies on the 21-nt RNA molecule and sequence variants showed that this sequence can form a hairpin and a dimer complex. Unexpectedly, the hairpin to dimer conversion was shown to occur at high efficiency in frozen solution, although little or no conversion was observed above 0{$^\circ$}C. The results indicate that a freezing environment can promote formation of intermolecular RNA complexes from stable RNA hairpins, supporting the notion that this environment could have played a role in the evolution of RNA complexity.},

  abstract = {In our recent works, based on the structural studies on water and interfacial water (topmost water layer at the solute/water interface), hydration free energy is derived and utilized to investigate the physical origin of hydrophobic interactions. In this study, it is extended to investigate the structural origin of hydration repulsive force. As a solute is embedded into water, it mainly affects the structure of interfacial water, which is dependent on the geometric shape of solute. Therefore, hydrophobic interactions may be related to the surface roughness of solute. According to this study, hydration repulsive force can reasonably be ascribed to the effects of surface roughness of solutes on hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, hydration repulsive force can only be expected as the size of surface roughness being less than Rc (critical radius), which is in correspondence with the initial solvation process as discussed in our recent work. Additionally, this can be demonstrated by potential of mean force (PMF) calculated using molecular dynamics simulations.},

However, BLI in the central nervous system remains challenging because luciferases show relatively poor performance in the brain with existing substrates. Here, we report the discovery of a NanoLuc substrate with improved brain performance, cephalofurimazine (CFz). CFz paired with Antares luciferase produces greater than 20-fold more signal from the brain than the standard combination of               d               -luciferin with firefly luciferase. At standard doses, Antares--CFz matches AkaLuc--AkaLumine/TokeOni in brightness, while occasional higher dosing of CFz can be performed to obtain threefold more signal. CFz should allow the growing number of NanoLuc-based indicators to be applied to the brain with high sensitivity. Using CFz, we achieve video-rate non-invasive imaging of Antares in brains of freely moving mice and demonstrate non-invasive calcium imaging of sensory-evoked activity in genetically defined neurons.},

  abstract = {Although the progress of aging research relies heavily on a theoretical framework, today there is no consensus on many critical questions in aging biology. I hypothesize that a systematic analysis of the intersection of different evolutionary mechanisms of aging with diverse resource allocation strategies in different organisms may reconcile aging hypotheses. The application of disposable soma, mutation accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and life-history theory is considered across organisms with asexual reproduction, organisms with sexual repro\textbackslash - duction and indeterminate growth in different conditions of extrinsic mortality, and organisms with determinate growth, with endotherms/homeotherms as a subgroup. This review demonstrates that different aging mecha\textbackslash - nisms are complementary to each other, and in organisms with different resource allocation strategies they form aging modalities ranging from immortality to suicidal programs. It also revamps the role of growth arrest in aging. Growth arrest evolved in many different groups of organisms as a result of resource reallocation from growth to reproduction (e.g., semelparous animals, holometabolic insects), or from growth to nutrient storage (endotherms/homeotherms). Growth arrest in different animal lineages has similar molecular mechanisms and similar consequences for longevity due to the conflict between growth-promoting and growth-suppressing pro\textbackslash - grams and suppression of regenerative capacity.}

Fisetin (3,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone) belongs to the flavonol subgroup of flavonoids together with quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol and is found in several fruits and vegetables including strawberries, apples, persimmons and onions. Fisetin is showing promise as a useful natural agent against cancer and has been evaluated for its potential inhibitory role against cancer in several in vitro and in vivo studies. The Akt/mTOR pathway is known to play a central role in various cellular processes that contribute to the malignant phenotype. Accordingly, inhibition of this signaling cascade has been a focus of recent therapeutic studies. Novel inhibitors of PI3-K, Akt, and mTOR are now passing through early phase clinical trials.

Low levels of both deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and the biosynthetic enzymes required for their de novo synthesis provide one barrier to infection. CD4+ T cell activation induces metabolic reprogramming that reverses this block and facilitates HIV-1 replication. Here, we show that phospholipase D1 (PLD1) links T cell activation signals to increased HIV-1 permissivity by triggering a c-Myc-dependent transcriptional program that coordinates glucose uptake and nucleotide biosynthesis. Decreasing PLD1 activity pharmacologically or by RNA interference diminished c-Myc-dependent expression during T cell activation at the RNA and protein levels. PLD1 inhibition of HIV-1 infection was partially rescued by adding exogenous deoxyribonucleosides that bypass the need for de novo dNTP synthesis. Moreover, the data indicate that low dNTP levels that impact HIV-1 restriction involve decreased synthesis, and not only increased catabolism of these nucleotides. These findings uncover a unique mechanism of action for PLD1 inhibitors and support their further development as part of a therapeutic combination for HIV-1 and other viral infections dependent on host nucleotide biosynthesis.}

  abstract = {Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death 1. Despite rapid advances over recent years 2, many of the molecular and cellular processes which underlie progressive loss of healthy physiology are poorly understood. To gain a better insight into these processes we have created a single cell transcriptomic atlas across the life span of Mus musculus which includes data from 18 tissues and organs. We discovered cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data we were able to assess cell type specific manifestations of different hallmarks of aging, such as senescence 3, changes in the activity of metabolic pathways 4, depletion of stem-cell populations 5, genomic instability 6 and the role of inflammation as well as other changes in the organism's immune system2. This Tabula Muris Senis provides a wealth of new molecular information about how the most significant hallmarks of aging are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types.}

  abstract = {Psychedelics have attracted medical interest, but their effects on human brain function are incompletely understood. In a comprehensive, within-subjects, placebo-controlled design, we acquired multimodal neuroimaging [i.e., EEG-fMRI~(electroencephalography-functional MRI)] data to assess the effects of intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on brain function in 20 healthy volunteers. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired prior to, during, and after a bolus IV administration of 20 mg DMT, and, separately, placebo. At dosages consistent with the present study, DMT, a serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist, induces a deeply immersive and radically altered state of consciousness. DMT is thus a useful research tool for probing the neural correlates of conscious experience. Here, fMRI results revealed robust increases in global functional connectivity (GFC), network disintegration and desegregation, and a compression of the principal cortical gradient under DMT. GFC \texttimes{} subjective intensity maps correlated with independent positron emission tomography (PET)-derived 5-HT2AR maps, and both overlapped with meta-analytical data implying human-specific psychological functions. Changes in major EEG-measured neurophysiological properties correlated with specific changes in various fMRI metrics, enriching our understanding of the neural basis of DMT's effects. The present findings advance on previous work by confirming a predominant action of DMT---and likely other 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics---on the brain's transmodal association pole, i.e., the neurodevelopmentally and evolutionarily recent cortex that is associated with species-specific psychological advancements, and high expression of 5-HT2A receptors.},

Despite the ubiquity of methyltransferases and the immense variety of possible methylation patterns, epigenomic diversity remains unexplored for most bacterial species. Members of the               Bacteroides fragilis               group (BFG) reside in the human gastrointestinal tract as key players in symbiotic communities but also can establish anaerobic infections that are increasingly multi-drug resistant. In this work, we utilize long-read sequencing technologies to perform pangenomic (               n               \,=\,383) and panepigenomic (               n               \,=\,268) analysis of clinical BFG isolates cultured from infections seen at the NIH Clinical Center over four decades. Our analysis reveals that single BFG species harbor hundreds of DNA methylation motifs, with most individual motif combinations occurring uniquely in single isolates, implying immense unsampled methylation diversity within BFG epigenomes. Mining of BFG genomes identified more than 6000 methyltransferase genes, approximately 1000 of which were associated with intact prophages. Network analysis revealed substantial gene flow among disparate phage genomes, implying a role for genetic exchange between BFG phages as one of the ultimate sources driving BFG epigenome diversity.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Target occupancy is often insufficient to elicit biological activity, particularly for RNA, compounded by the longstanding challenges surrounding the molecular recognition of RNA structures by small molecules. Here we studied molecular recognition patterns between a natural-product-inspired small-molecule collection and three-dimensionally folded RNA structures. Mapping these interaction landscapes across the human transcriptome defined structure--activity relationships. Although RNA-binding compounds that bind to functional sites were expected to elicit a biological response, most identified interactions were predicted to be biologically inert as they bind elsewhere. We reasoned that, for such cases, an alternative strategy to modulate RNA biology is to cleave the target through a ribonuclease-targeting chimera, where an RNA-binding molecule is appended to a heterocycle that binds to and locally activates RNase L               1               . Overlay of the substrate specificity for RNase L with the binding landscape of small molecules revealed many favourable candidate binders that might be bioactive when converted into degraders. We provide a proof of concept, designing selective degraders for the precursor to the disease-associated microRNA-155 (pre-miR-155),               JUN               mRNA and               MYC               mRNA. Thus, small-molecule RNA-targeted degradation can be leveraged to convert strong, yet inactive, binding interactions into potent and specific modulators of RNA function.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Genetic defects in telomere maintenance and repair cause bone marrow failure, liver cirrhosis, and pulmonary fibrosis, and they increase susceptibility to cancer. Historically, androgens have been useful as treatment for marrow failure syndromes. In tissue culture and animal models, sex hormones regulate expression of the telomerase gene. METHODS In a phase 1-- 2 prospective study involving patients with telomere diseases, we administered the synthetic sex hormone danazol orally at a dose of 800 mg per day for a total of 24 months. The goal of treatment was the attenuation of accelerated telomere attrition, and the primary efficacy end point was a 20\% reduction in the annual rate of telomere attrition measured at 24 months. The occurrence of toxic effects of treatment was the primary safety end point. Hematologic response to treatment at various time points was the secondary efficacy end point. RESULTS After 27 patients were enrolled, the study was halted early, because telomere attrition was reduced in all 12 patients who could be evaluated for the primary end point; in the intention-to-treat analysis, 12 of 27 patients (44\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 26 to 64) met the primary efficacy end point. Unexpectedly, almost all the patients (11 of 12, 92\%) had a gain in telomere length at 24 months as compared with baseline (mean increase, 386 bp [95\% CI, 178 to 593]); in exploratory analyses, similar increases were observed at 6 months (16 of 21 patients; mean increase, 175 bp [95\% CI, 79 to 271]) and 12 months (16 of 18 patients; mean increase, 360 bp [95\% CI, 209 to 512]). Hematologic responses occurred in 19 of 24 patients (79\%) who could be evaluated at 3 months and in 10 of 12 patients (83\%) who could be evaluated at 24 months. Known adverse effects of danazol --- elevated liver-enzyme levels and muscle cramps --- of grade 2 or less occurred in 41\% and 33\% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In our study, treatment with danazol led to telomere elongation in patients with telomere diseases. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01441037.)}

To characterize these changes, RNA was extracted and sequenced from muscle biopsies collected from 53 healthy individuals (22-- 83 years old) of the GESTALT study of the National Institute on Aging-- NIH. Expression levels of 57,205 protein-coding and non-coding RNAs were studied as a function of aging by linear and negative binomial regression models. From both models, 1134 RNAs changed significantly with age. The most differentially abundant mRNAs encoded proteins implicated in several age-related processes, including cellular senescence, insulin signaling, and myogenesis. Specific mRNA isoforms that changed significantly with age in skeletal muscle were enriched for proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and adipogenesis. Our study establishes a detailed framework of the global transcriptome and mRNA isoforms that govern muscle damage and homeostasis with age.}

As the neural network's optimum design is important and is problem-specific, the influence of some of the key factors on the model's accuracy is also investigated. To confirm the approach's efficacy, the outcomes of the suggested method were compared with those of the existing approaches. The suggested method was observed to be both efficient and accurate.},

The cause of this lethality is unknown. Here we show, using flies and mice, that sleep deprivation leads to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequent oxidative stress, specifically in the gut. ROS are not just correlates of sleep deprivation but drivers of death: their neutralization prevents oxidative stress and allows flies to have a normal lifespan with little to no sleep. The rescue can be achieved with oral antioxidant compounds or with gut-targeted transgenic expression of antioxidant enzymes. We conclude that death upon severe sleep restriction can be caused by oxidative stress, that the gut is central in this process, and that survival without sleep is possible when ROS accumulation is prevented.}

Automated machine-learning (AutoML) algorithms can address many challenges that come with applying ML to the life sciences. However, these algorithms are rarely used in systems and synthetic biology studies because they typically do not explicitly handle biological sequences (e.g., nucleotide, amino acid, or glycan sequences) and cannot be easily compared with other AutoML algorithms. Here, we present BioAutoMATED, an AutoML platform for biological sequence analysis that integrates multiple AutoML methods into a unified framework. Users are automatically provided with relevant techniques for analyzing, interpreting, and designing biological sequences. BioAutoMATED predicts gene regulation, peptide-drug interactions, and glycan annotation, and designs optimized synthetic biology components, revealing salient sequence characteristics. By automating sequence modeling, BioAutoMATED allows life scientists to incorporate ML more readily into their work.},

Here, we assessed GH secretion and its control in relation with human familial longevity. We frequently sampled blood over 24 h in 19 middle-aged offspring of long-living families from the Leiden Longevity Study together with 18 of their partners as controls. Circulating GH concentrations were measured every 10 min and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) every 4 h. Using deconvolution analysis, we found that 24-h total GH secretion was 28\% lower (P = 0.04) in offspring [172 (128-- 216) mU L\`A1] compared with controls [238 (193-- 284) mU L\`A1]. We used approximate entropy (ApEn) to quantify the strength of feedback/feedforward control of GH secretion. ApEn was lower (P = 0.001) in offspring [0.45 (0.39-- 0.53)] compared with controls [0.66 (0.56-- 0.77)], indicating tighter control of GH secretion. No significant differences were observed in circulating levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP3 between offspring and controls. In conclusion, GH secretion in human familial longevity is characterized by diminished secretion rate and more tight control. These data imply that the highly conserved GH signaling pathway, which has been linked to longevity in animal models, is also associated with human longevity.}

The nuclear magnetic resonance, x-ray structure, and many spectroscopic studies with AFPs have been instrumental in determining the structure--function relationship. Mutational studies have indicated the importance of hydrophobic residues in ice binding. Various studies have pointed out that the mechanism of AFP action is through its adsorption on the ice surface, which leads to a curved surface, preventing further growth of ice by the ``Kelvin effect.'' The AFPs have potential industrial, medical, and agricultural application in different fields, such as food technology, preservation of cell lines, organs, cryosurgery, and cold hardy transgenic plants and animals. However, the applications of AFPs are marred by high cost due to low yield. This review deals with the source and properties of AFPs from an angle of their application and their potential. The possibility of production using different molecular biological techniques, which will help increase the yield, is also dealt with.},

  pages = {10},
  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate combining blocking and collapsing -- two widely used strategies for improving the accuracy of Gibbs sampling -- in the context of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). We show that combining them is not straight-forward because collapsing (or eliminating variables) introduces new dependencies in the PGM and in computation-limited settings, this may adversely affect blocking. We therefore propose a principled approach for tackling this problem. Specifically, we develop two scoring functions, one each for blocking and collapsing, and formulate the problem of partitioning the variables in the PGM into blocked and collapsed subsets as simultaneously maximizing both scoring functions (i.e., a multi-objective optimization problem). We propose a dynamic, greedy algorithm for approximately solving this intractable optimization problem. Our dynamic algorithm periodically updates the partitioning into blocked and collapsed variables by leveraging correlation statistics gathered from the generated samples and enables rapid mixing by blocking together and collapsing highly correlated variables. We demonstrate experimentally the clear benefit of our dynamic approach: as more samples are drawn, our dynamic approach significantly outperforms static graph-based approaches by an order of magnitude in terms of accuracy.}

We have translated this network into a Boolean model to study possible cell phenotype outcomes under diverse molecular signaling conditions. In the context of insulin resistance, the model was able to reproduce the variations of the senescence level observed in tissues related to T2DM's main morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, by calibrating the pharmacodynamics of mTOR inhibitors, we have been able to reproduce the dose-dependent effect of rapamycin on liver degeneration and lifespan expansion in wildtype and HER2-- neu mice. Using the model, we have finally performed an in silico prospective screen of the risk-- benefit ratio of rapamycin dosage for healthy lifespan expansion strategies.

Although a classical concept in ecology, niche breadth has remained challenging to quantify for microorganisms because it depends on an objective definition of the environment. Here, by defining the environment of a microorganism as the community it resides in, we integrated information from over 22,000 environmental sequencing samples to derive a quantitative measure of the niche, which we call social niche breadth. At the level of genera, we explored niche range strategies throughout the prokaryotic tree of life. We found that social generalists include opportunists that stochastically dominate local communities, whereas social specialists are stable but low in abundance. Social generalists have a more diverse and open pan-genome than social specialists, but we found no global correlation between social niche breadth and genome size. Instead, we observed two distinct evolutionary strategies, whereby specialists have relatively small genomes in habitats with low local diversity, but relatively large genomes in habitats with high local diversity. Together, our analysis shines data-driven light on microbial niche range strategies.},

Patterns of RNA expression in the hippocampus of 15-month-old mice were similar between mice fed CR and LPHC diets when we looked at genes associated with longevity, cytokines, and dendrite morphogenesis. Nutrient-sensing proteins, including SIRT1, mTOR, and PGC1a, were also influenced by diet; however, the effects varied by sex.

Generating programs for robots from natural language instructions is an attractive goal, but the practical application using ChatGPT is still in its early stages, and there is no established methodology yet. Here, we have designed easy-to-customize input prompts for ChatGPT that meet common requirements in many practical applications, including: 1) easy integration with robot execution systems or visual recognition programs, 2) applicability to various environments, and 3) the ability to provide long-step instructions while minimizing the impact of ChatGPT's token limit. Specifically, the prompts encourage ChatGPT to 1) output a sequence of predefined robot actions with explanations in a readable JSON format, 2) represent the operating environment in a formalized style, and 3) infer and output the updated state of the operating environment as the result of each operation, which will be input with the next instruction to allow ChatGPT to work based solely on the memory of the latest operations. Through experiments, we confirmed that the proposed prompts allow ChatGPT to act in accordance with the requirements in various environments. Additionally, we observed that ChatGPT's conversational ability allows users to adjust its output with natural language feedback, which is crucial for developing an application that is both safe and robust while providing a user-friendly interface. Users can easily customize the prompts as templates. The contribution of this paper is to provide and publish the prompts, which are generic enough to be easily modified to fit the requirements of each experimenter, thereby providing practical knowledge to the robotics research community.

Compositional and structural analyses indicated that this antifreeze contains a {$\beta$}-mannopyranosyl-(1{$\rightarrow$}4) {$\beta$}-xylopyranose backbone and a fatty acid component, although the lipid may not be covalently linked to the saccharide. Consistent with the proposed structure, treatment with               endo               -{$\beta$}-(1{$\rightarrow$}4)xylanase ablated TH activity.

However for saving resources, a more economic strategy should be to make a rapid death to the individuals who are over the reproduction age rather than to make them aging. Biological theories are proposed to identify the causes and the biological processes of aging. However, some theories including cell senescence/telomere theory, gene-controlling theory, and developmental theory, have unfortunately ignored the influence of damage on aging. Free-radical theory suggests that free radicals by causing intrinsic damage are the main cause of aging. However, even if intracellular free radicals cause injuries, they could be only associated with some but not all of the aging changes. Damage (fault)-accumulation theory predicts that faults as intrinsic damage can accumulate and lead to aging. However, in fact an unrepaired fault could not possibly remain in a living organism, since it can destroy the integrity of tissue structure and cause rapid failure of the organism. These traditional theories are all incomplete on interpreting aging phenomena. Nevertheless, developmental theory and damage (fault)-accumulation theory are more useful, because they have recognized the importance of damage and development process in aging. Some physical theories are useful, because they point out the common characteristics of aging changes, including loss of complexity, consequence of increase of entropy, and failure of information-transmission. An advanced theory, which can include all of these useful ideas in traditional theories, is needed.}

Hierarchical feature selection is a new research area in classification research, since nearly all feature selection methods ignore hierarchical relationships among features. This paper proposes two methods for constructing a network of features to be used by a Bayesian Network Augmented Na\textasciidieresis\i{} ve Bayes (BAN) classifier, in datasets of aging-related genes where Gene Ontology (GO) terms are used as hierarchically related predictive features. One of the BAN network construction method relies on a hierarchical feature selection method to detect and remove hierarchical redundancies among features (GO terms); whilst the other BAN network construction method simply uses a conventional, flat feature selection method to select features, without removing the hierarchical redundancies associated with the GO. Both BAN network construction methods may create new edges among nodes (features) in the BAN network that did not exist in the original GO DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), in order to preserve the generalization-specialization (ancestor-descendant) relationship among selected features. Experiments comparing these two BAN network construction methods, when using two different hierarchical feature selection methods and one flat feature selection method, have shown that the best results are obtained by the BAN network construction method using one type of hierarchical feature selection method, i.e., select Hierarchical Information-Preserving features (HIP).},

  abstract = {Abstract The ribosomal RNA gene, which consists of tandem repetitive arrays (rDNA repeat), is one of the most unstable regions in the genome. The rDNA repeat in the budding yeast is known to become unstable as the cell ages. However, it is unclear how the rDNA repeat changes in ageing mammalian cells. Using quantitative analyses, we identified age-dependent alterations in rDNA copy number and levels of methylation in mice. The degree of methylation and copy number of rDNA from bone marrow cells of 2-year-old mice were increased by comparison to 4-week-old mice in two mouse strains, BALB/cA and C57BL/6. Moreover, the level of pre-rRNA transcripts was reduced in older BALB/cA mice. We also identified many sequence variations among the repeats with two mutations being unique to old mice. These sequences were conserved in budding yeast and equivalent mutations shortened the yeast chronological lifespan. Our findings suggest that rDNA is also fragile in mammalian cells and alterations within this region have a profound effect on cellular function. Author Summary The ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) is one of the most unstable regions in the genome due to its tandem repetitive structure. rDNA copy number in the budding yeast increases and becomes unstable as the cell ages. It is speculated that the rDNA produces an ``aging signal'' inducing senescence and death. However, it is unclear how the rDNA repeat changes during the aging process in mammalian cells. In this study, we attempted to identify the age-dependent alteration of rDNA in mice. Using quantitative single cell analysis, we show that rDNA copy number increases in old mice bone marrow cells. By contrast, the level of ribosomal RNA production was reduced because of increased levels of DNA methylation that represses transcription. We also identified many sequence variations in the rDNA. Among them, three mutations were unique to old mice and two of them were found in the conserved region in budding yeast. We then established a yeast strain with the old mouse-specific mutations and found this shortened the lifespan of the cells. These findings suggest that rDNA is also fragile in mammalian cells and alteration to this region of the genome affects cellular senescence.}

  abstract = {Mitochondrial network remodeling between fused and fragmented states facilitates mitophagy, interaction with other organelles, and metabolic flexibility. Aging is associated with a loss of mitochondrial network homeostasis, but cellular processes causally linking these changes to organismal senescence remain unclear. Here, we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and dietary restriction (DR) promote longevity in C. elegans via maintaining mitochondrial network homeostasis and functional coordination with peroxisomes to increase fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Inhibiting fusion or fission specifically blocks AMPK- and DR-mediated longevity. Strikingly, however, preserving mitochondrial network homeostasis during aging by co-inhibition of fusion and fission is sufficient itself to increase lifespan, while dynamic network remodeling is required for intermittent fasting-mediated longevity. Finally, we show that increasing lifespan via maintaining mitochondrial network homeostasis requires FAO and peroxisomal function. Together, these data demonstrate that mechanisms that promote mitochondrial homeostasis and plasticity can be targeted to promote healthy aging.}

  abstract = {Significance The exact causes of aging are still not understood, and it is unclear why some species live less than 1 d, while others can live more than 400 y. Research suggests that telomeres are related to the aging process, but a clear relationship between the life span of a species and initial telomere length has not been observed. Here, we measure the telomere lengths of a variety of different species. We find that, in fact, there is no strong correlation between the life span of a species and initial telomere length. However, we find a strong correlation between the telomere shortening rate and the life span of a species. , Telomere shortening to a critical length can trigger aging and shorter life spans in mice and humans by a mechanism that involves induction of a persistent DNA damage response at chromosome ends and loss of cellular viability. However, whether telomere length is a universal determinant of species longevity is not known. To determine whether telomere shortening can be a single parameter to predict species longevities, here we measured in parallel the telomere length of a wide variety of species (birds and mammals) with very different life spans and body sizes, including mouse ( Mus musculus ), goat ( Capra hircus ), Audouin's gull ( Larus audouinii ), reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus ), griffon vulture ( Gyps fulvus ), bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ), American flamingo ( Phoenicopterus ruber ), and Sumatran elephant ( Elephas maximus sumatranus ). We found that the telomere shortening rate, but not the initial telomere length alone, is a powerful predictor of species life span. These results support the notion that critical telomere shortening and the consequent onset of telomeric DNA damage and cellular senescence are a general determinant of species life span.}

In all cases, however, senescent cells comprise only a small fraction of tissues. Senescent phenotypes have been studied largely in relatively homogeneous populations of cultured cells. In vivo, senescent cells are generally identified by a small number of markers, but whether and how these markers vary among individual cells is unknown. We therefore utilized a combination of single-cell isolation and a nanofluidic PCR platform to determine the contributions of individual cells to the overall gene expression profile of senescent human fibroblast populations. Individual senescent cells were surprisingly heterogeneous in their gene expression signatures. This cell-to-cell variability resulted in a loss of correlation among the expression of several senescenceassociated genes. Many genes encoding senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, a major contributor to the effects of senescent cells in vivo, showed marked variability with a subset of highly induced genes accounting for the increases observed at the population level. Inflammatory genes in clustered genomic loci showed a greater correlation with senescence compared to nonclustered loci, suggesting that these genes are coregulated by genomic location. Together, these data offer new insights into how genes are regulated in senescent cells and suggest that single markers are inadequate to identify senescent cells in vivo.}

Here, we demonstrate the first speech-to-text BCI that records spiking activity from intracortical microelectrode arrays. Enabled by these high-resolution recordings, our study participant, who can no longer speak intelligibly due amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), achieved a 9.1\% word error rate on a 50 word vocabulary (2.7 times fewer errors than the prior state of the art speech BCI             2             ) and a 23.8\% word error rate on a 125,000 word vocabulary (the first successful demonstration of large-vocabulary decoding).

Finally, we highlight two aspects of the neural code for speech that are encouraging for speech BCIs: spatially intermixed tuning to speech articulators that makes accurate decoding possible from only a small region of cortex, and a detailed articulatory representation of phonemes that persists years after paralysis. These results show a feasible path forward for using intracortical speech BCIs to restore rapid communication to people with paralysis who can no longer speak.},

CSF flow is thus important for brain health, but the mechanisms that control its large-scale movement through the ventricles are not well understood. While it is well established that CSF flow is modulated by respiratory and cardiovascular dynamics, recent work has also demonstrated that neural activity is coupled to large waves of CSF flow in the ventricles during sleep. To test whether the temporal coupling between neural activity and CSF flow is in part due to a causal relationship, we investigated whether CSF flow could be induced by driving neural activity with intense visual stimulation. We manipulated neural activity with a flickering checkerboard visual stimulus and found that we could drive macroscopic CSF flow in the human brain. The timing and amplitude of CSF flow was matched to the visually evoked hemodynamic responses, suggesting neural activity can modulate CSF flow via neurovascular coupling. These results demonstrate that neural activity can contribute to driving CSF flow in the human brain and that the temporal dynamics of neurovascular coupling can explain this effect.},

To define age-dependent changes at the systems level, we profile the circadian transcriptome in the hypothalamus, lung, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, and adrenal gland in three age groups. We find age-dependent and tissue-specific clock output changes. Aging reduces the number of rhythmically expressed genes (REGs), indicative of weakened circadian control. REGs are enriched for the hallmarks of aging, adding another dimension to our understanding of aging. Analyzing differential gene expression within a tissue at four different times of day identifies distinct clusters of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Increased variability of gene expression across the day is a common feature of aged tissues. This analysis extends the landscape for understanding aging and highlights the impact of aging on circadian clock function and temporal changes in gene expression.},

However, the invasive nature of the standard pre-surgical investigation contributes to fewer than 1\% of patients with PA being offered the chance of a cure. The primary objective of our prospective study of 143 patients with PA (               NCT02945904               ) was to compare the accuracy of a non-invasive test, [               11               C]metomidate positron emission tomography computed tomography (MTO) scanning, with adrenal vein sampling (AVS) in predicting the biochemical remission of PA and the resolution of hypertension after surgery.

The accuracies of MTO at predicting biochemical and clinical success following adrenalectomy were, respectively, 72.7 and 65.4\%. For AVS, the accuracies were 63.6 and 61.5\%.

Egr-1               deletion accelerates liver age-related metabolic dysfunction, which associates with increased triglyceride accumulation, disruption of the opposite rhythmic coupling of Egr-1 and Cidea (Cell Death Inducing DFFA Like Effector A) at the transcriptional level and~large lipid droplet formation. Importantly, adjustment of the central clock with light via a 4-hour forward shift in 6-month-old mice, leads to recovery the rhythm shift of Egr-1 during aging and largely ameliorated liver metabolic dysfunction.

  abstract = {Abstract             We propose an ultra-low-cost at-home blood pressure monitor that leverages a plastic clip with a spring-loaded mechanism to enable a smartphone with a flash LED and camera to measure blood pressure. Our system, called BPClip, is based on the scientific premise of measuring oscillometry at the fingertip to measure blood pressure. To enable a smartphone to measure the pressure applied to the digital artery, a moveable pinhole projection moves closer to the camera as the user presses down on the clip with increased force. As a user presses on the device with increased force, the spring-loaded mechanism compresses. The size of the pinhole thus encodes the pressure applied to the finger. In conjunction, the brightness fluctuation of the pinhole projection correlates to the arterial pulse amplitude. By capturing the size and brightness of the pinhole projection with the built-in camera, the smartphone can measure a user's blood pressure with only a low-cost, plastic clip and an app. Unlike prior approaches, this system does not require a blood pressure cuff measurement for a user-specific calibration compared to pulse transit time and pulse wave analysis based blood pressure monitoring solutions. Our solution also does not require specialized smartphone models with custom sensors. Our early feasibility finding demonstrates that in a validation study with N~=~29 participants with systolic blood pressures ranging from 88 to 157~mmHg, the BPClip system can achieve a mean absolute error of 8.72 and 5.49 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. In an estimated cost projection study, we demonstrate that in small-batch manufacturing of 1000 units,~the material cost is an estimated \$0.80, suggesting that at full-scale production, our proposed BPClip concept can be produced at very low~cost compared to existing cuff-based monitors for at-home blood pressure management.},

A driving spring model in a liquid-vapor molecular ensemble is used to explore the force oscillation mechanism. It has been found that OMCTS fluid in tip-substrate contact has a strong tendency to form a layered structure, starting from n = 8 layers. The force profile obtained from simulation is qualitatively similar to those in contact mode AFM experiments. However, the bulk-like diffusion and rotation of OMCTS molecules underneath the AFM tip suggest that, under the tip-substrate confinement geometry, the layered OMCTS film cannot form a solidified structure except under n = 2 extreme contact-layer confinement.},

  abstract = {The brain is assumed to be hypoactive during cardiac arrest. However, animal models of cardiac and respiratory arrest demonstrate a surge of gamma oscillations and functional connectivity. To investigate whether these preclinical findings translate to humans, we analyzed electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram signals in four comatose dying patients before and after the withdrawal of ventilatory support. Two of the four patients exhibited a rapid and marked surge of gamma power, surge of cross-frequency coupling of gamma waves with slower oscillations, and increased interhemispheric functional and directed connectivity in gamma bands. High-frequency oscillations paralleled the activation of beta/gamma cross-frequency coupling within the somatosensory cortices. Importantly, both patients displayed surges of functional and directed connectivity at multiple frequency bands within the posterior cortical ``hot zone,'' a region postulated to be critical for conscious processing. This gamma activity was stimulated by global hypoxia and surged further as cardiac conditions deteriorated in the dying patients. These data demonstrate that the surge of gamma power and connectivity observed in animal models of cardiac arrest can be observed in select patients during the process of dying.},

  abstract = {Senescent cells accumulate in fat with aging. We previously found genetic clearance of senescent cells from progeroid INK-ATTAC mice prevents lipodystrophy. Here we show that primary human senescent fat progenitors secrete activin A and directly inhibit adipogenesis in non-senescent progenitors. Blocking activin A partially restored lipid accumulation and expression of key adipogenic markers in differentiating progenitors exposed to senescent cells. Mouse fat tissue activin A increased with aging. Clearing senescent cells from 18-month-old naturally-aged INK-ATTAC mice reduced circulating activin A, blunted fat loss, and enhanced adipogenic transcription factor expression within 3 weeks. JAK inhibitor suppressed senescent cell activin A production and blunted senescent cell-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis. Eight weeks-treatment with ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved JAK1/2 inhibitor, reduced circulating activin A, preserved fat mass, reduced lipotoxicity, and increased insulin sensitivity in 22-month-old mice. Our study indicates targeting senescent cells or their products may alleviate age-related dysfunction of progenitors, adipose tissue, and metabolism. , The likelihood of developing metabolic diseases such as diabetes increases with age. This is, in part, because the cells within fat and other tissues become less sensitive to the hormone insulin as people and other animals get older. Also, the stem cells that give rise to new, insulin-responsive fat cells become dysfunctional with increasing age. This is related to the accumulation of ``senescent'' cells, which, unlike normal fat cell progenitors, release molecules that are toxic to nearby and distant cells. Xu, Palmer et al. have now investigated if senescent cells interfere with the activity of stem cells from human fat tissue, and if getting rid of these senescent cells might restore the normal activity and insulin responsiveness of aged fat tissue. The experiments revealed that human senescent fat cell progenitors release a protein called activin A, which impedes the normal function of stem cells and fat tissue. Additionally, older mice had higher levels of activin A in both their blood and fat tissue than young mice. Xu, Palmer et al. then analyzed older mice that had been engineered to have senescent fat cells that could be triggered to essentially kill themselves when the mice were treated with a drug. Eliminating the senescent cells from these mice led to lower levels of activin A and more fat tissue (due to improved stem cell capacity to become fully functional fat cells) that expressed genes required for insulin responsiveness. This showed that senescent cells are a cause of age-related fat tissue loss and metabolic disease in older mice. Next, Xu, Palmer et al. treated older mice with drugs called JAK inhibitors, which they found reduce the production of activin A by senescent cells isolated from fat tissue. After two months of treatment, the levels of activin A in the blood and in fat tissue were indeed reduced. The fat tissue in treated mice also showed fewer features associated with the development of diabetes than the fat tissue of untreated mice. As such, these results paralleled those after selectively eliminating the senescent cells. Together these findings suggest that JAK inhibitors or drugs (called senolytics) that selectively eliminate senescent cells may have clinical benefits in treating age-related conditions such as diabetes and stem cell dysfunction.}

The typically weak Brillouin scattering signal can be substantially enhanced via a stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) process; however, current implementations require high pump powers, which prohibit applications to photosensitive or live imaging of biological samples. Here we present a pulsed SBS scheme that takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the pump--probe interaction. In particular, we show that the required pump laser power can be decreased \textasciitilde 20-fold without affecting the signal levels or spectral precision. We demonstrate the low phototoxicity and high specificity of our pulsed SBS approach by imaging, with subcellular detail, sensitive single cells, zebrafish larvae, mouse embryos and adult Caenorhabditis elegans. Furthermore, our method permits observing the mechanics of organoids and C. elegans embryos over time, opening up further possibilities for the field of mechanobiology.},

Invited Commentary page 525 Supplemental content at jamainternalmedicine.com DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 1988-1994 [III], 1999-2004, and 2005-2010 [n = 31 147]) for the time trend analysis and NHANES III Linked Mortality cohort (1988-2006 [n = 11 733]), a prospective cohort of a nationally representative sample of US adults for the association study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular disease mortality. RESULTS Among US adults, the adjusted mean percentage of daily calories from added sugar increased from 15.7\% (95\% CI, 15.0\%-16.4\%) in 1988-1994 to 16.8\% (16.0\%-17.7\%; P = .02) in 1999-2004 and decreased to 14.9\% (14.2\%-15.5\%; P {$<$} .001) in 2005-2010. Most adults consumed 10\% or more of calories from added sugar (71.4\%) and approximately 10\% consumed 25\% or more in 2005-2010. During a median follow-up period of 14.6 years, we documented 831 CVD deaths during 163 039 person-years. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-- adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of CVD mortality across quintiles of the percentage of daily calories consumed from added sugar were 1.00 (reference), 1.09 (95\% CI, 1.05-1.13), 1.23 (1.12-1.34), 1.49 (1.24-1.78), and 2.43 (1.63-3.62; P {$<$} .001), respectively. After additional adjustment for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics, HRs were 1.00 (reference), 1.07 (1.02-1.12), 1.18 (1.06-1.31), 1.38 (1.11-1.70), and 2.03 (1.26-3.27; P = .004), respectively. Adjusted HRs were 1.30 (95\% CI, 1.09-1.55) and 2.75 (1.40-5.42; P = .004), respectively, comparing participants who consumed 10.0\% to 24.9\% or 25.0\% or more calories from added sugar with those who consumed less than 10.0\% of calories from added sugar. These findings were largely consistent across age group, sex, race/ethnicity (except among non-Hispanic blacks), educational attainment, physical activity, health eating index, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most US adults consume more added sugar than is recommended for a healthy diet. We observed a significant relationship between added sugar consumption and increased risk for CVD mortality.}

  abstract = {All living things experience an increase in entropy, manifested as a loss of genetic and epigenetic information. In yeast, epigenetic information is lost over time due to the relocalization of chromatin-modifying proteins to DNA breaks, causing cells to lose their identity, a hallmark of yeast aging. Using a system called ``ICE'' (inducible changes to the epigenome), we find that the act of faithful DNA repair advances aging at physiological, cognitive, and molecular levels, including erosion of the epigenetic landscape, cellular exdifferentiation, senescence, and advancement of the DNA methylation clock, which can be reversed by OSK-mediated rejuvenation. These data are consistent with the information theory of aging, which states that a loss of epigenetic information is a reversible cause of aging.}

Here we describe a deep-learning-based `family-wide hallucination' approach that generates large numbers of idealized protein structures containing diverse pocket shapes and designed sequences that encode them. We use these scaffolds to design artificial luciferases that selectively catalyse the oxidative chemiluminescence of the synthetic luciferin substrates diphenylterazine               3               and 2-deoxycoelenterazine. The designed active sites position an arginine guanidinium group adjacent to an anion that develops during the reaction in a binding pocket with high shape complementarity. For both luciferin substrates, we obtain designed luciferases with high selectivity; the most active of these is a small (13.9\,kDa) and thermostable (with a melting temperature higher than 95\,{$^\circ$}C) enzyme that has a catalytic efficiency on diphenylterazine (               k               cat               /               K               m               \,=\,10               6               \,M               -1               \,s               -1               )~comparable to that of native luciferases, but a much higher substrate specificity.

  abstract = {Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a well-known unsupervised approach for dimensionality reduction in information retrieval. However if the output information (i.e. category labels) is available, it is often beneficial to derive the indexing not only based on the inputs but also on the target values in the training data set. This is of particular importance in applications with multiple labels, in which each document can belong to several categories simultaneously. In this paper we introduce the multi-label informed latent semantic indexing (MLSI) algorithm which preserves the information of inputs and meanwhile captures the correlations between the multiple outputs. The recovered ``latent semantics'' thus incorporate the human-annotated category information and can be used to greatly improve the prediction accuracy. Empirical study based on two data sets, Reuters21578 and RCV1, demonstrates very encouraging results.}

Given the current interest in improving photosynthetic efficiency for greater crop yield, elucidating the detailed regulatory networks controlling the construction and maintenance of photosynthetic machinery is not only scientifically significant but also holding great potential in agricultural application. In this study, we first identified transcription factors (TFs) related to photosynthesis through the TRAP approach using position weight matrix information. Then, for TFs related to photosynthesis, interactions between them and their targets were also determined by the ARACNE approach. Finally, a gene regulatory network was established by combining TF-targets information generated by these two approaches. Topological analysis of the regulatory network suggested that (a) the regulatory network of photosynthesis has a property of ``small world''; (b) there is substantial coordination mediated by transcription factors between different components in photosynthesis.}

The SSNs generated by EFI-EST are used as the input for EFI-GNT and EFI-CGFP, enabling easy transfer of information among the tools. The networks are visualized and analyzed using Cytoscape, a widely used desktop application; GNDs and CGFP heatmaps summarizing metagenome abundance are viewed within the tools. We provide a detailed example of the integrated use of the tools with an analysis of glycyl radical enzyme superfamily (IPR004184) found in the human gut microbiome. This analysis demonstrates that (1) SwissProt annotations are not always correct, (2) large-scale genome context analyses allow the prediction of novel metabolic pathways, and (3) metagenome abundance can be used to identify/prioritize uncharacterized proteins for functional investigation.}

  abstract = {Significance             Water organization at solid--liquid interfaces plays a critical role in a range of applications related to adsorption, membrane separations, energy storage, and catalysis. Currently, our understanding of molecular water at solid interfaces is limited to macroscopic and bulk measurement approaches. These interrogation techniques lack the spatial and temporal resolutions necessary to detect how water interacts with local heterogeneous chemical microenvironments governed by surface chemistry, solutes, etc. This work reveals the interaction between water and two-dimensional MXenes by combining in situ ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and molecular dynamics simulation. This work demonstrates how the size of a solute (cation) governs transport within confined nanochannels and the hydration energy of the solute governs water adsorption/desorption properties at exposed surfaces.           ,                             A continuum of water populations can exist in nanoscale layered materials, which impacts transport phenomena relevant for separation, adsorption, and charge storage processes. Quantification and direct interrogation of water structure and organization are important in order to design materials with molecular-level control for emerging energy and water applications. Through combining molecular simulations with ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, we directly probe hydration mechanisms at confined and nonconfined regions in nanolayered transition-metal carbide materials. Hydrophobic (K               +               ) cations decrease water mobility within the confined interlayer and accelerate water removal at nonconfined surfaces. Hydrophilic cations (Li               +               ) increase water mobility within the confined interlayer and decrease water-removal rates at nonconfined surfaces. Solutes, rather than the surface terminating groups, are shown to be more impactful on the kinetics of water adsorption and desorption. Calculations from grand canonical molecular dynamics demonstrate that hydrophilic cations (Li               +               ) actively aid in water adsorption at MXene interfaces. In contrast, hydrophobic cations (K               +               ) weakly interact with water, leading to higher degrees of water ordering (orientation) and faster removal at elevated temperatures.},

Prior studies have explored the feasibility of establishing a brain-brain interface (BBI) across various brains via the combination of BMIs. However, using BBI to realize the efficient multidegree control of a living creature, such as a rat, to complete a navigation task in a complex environment has yet to be shown. In this study, we developed a BBI from the human brain to a rat implanted with microelectrodes (i.e., rat cyborg), which integrated electroencephalogram-based motor imagery and brain stimulation to realize human mind control of the rat's continuous locomotion. Control instructions were transferred from continuous motor imagery decoding results with the proposed control models and were wirelessly sent to the rat cyborg through brain micro-electrical stimulation. The results showed that rat cyborgs could be smoothly and successfully navigated by the human mind to complete a navigation task in a complex maze. Our experiments indicated that the cooperation through transmitting multidimensional information between two brains by computer-assisted BBI is promising.},

Growing evidence suggests that the mechanical interaction between the cells and their microenvironment is of critical importance to their behaviors under both normal and diseased conditions, such as migration, differentiation, and proliferation. The study of tissue mechanics in the past two decades, including the assessment of both mechanical properties and mechanical stresses of the extracellular microenvironment, has greatly enriched our knowledge about how cells interact with their mechanical environment. Tissue mechanical properties are often heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic, which makes them difficult to obtain from macroscale bulk measurements. Mechanical stresses were first measured for cells cultured on two-dimensional (2D) surfaces with well-defined mechanical properties. While 2D measurements are relatively straightforward and efficient, and they have provided us with valuable knowledge on cell-ECM interactions, that knowledge may not be directly applicable to in vivo systems. Hence, the measurement of tissue stresses in a more physiologically relevant three-dimensional (3D) environment is required. In this mini review, we will summarize and discuss recent developments in using optical, magnetic, genetic, and mechanical approaches to interrogate 3D tissue stresses and mechanical properties at the microscale.},

To find entry points for small molecules that might extend healthy longevity in humans, we screened \textbackslash 100,000 small molecules in a human primaryfibroblast cell line and identified a set that increased oxidative-stress resistance. Some of the hits fell into structurally related chemical groups, suggesting that they may act on common targets. Two small molecules increased C. elegans' stress resistance, and at least 9 extended their lifespan by \textbackslash 10-- 50\%. We further evaluated a chalcone that produced relatively large effects on lifespan and were able to implicate the activity of two, stress-response regulators, NRF2/skn-1 and SESN/sesn-1, in its mechanism of action. Our findings suggest that screening for increased stress resistance in human cells can enrich for compounds with promising pro-longevity effects. Further characterization of these compounds may reveal new ways to extend healthy human lifespan.}

Increases in red meat consumption over eight years were associated with a higher mortality risk in the subsequent eight years among women and men (both P for trend{$<$}0.05, P for heterogeneity=0.97). An increase in total red meat consumption of at least half a serving per day was associated with a 10\% higher mortality risk (pooled hazard ratio 1.10, 95\% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.17). For processed and unprocessed red meat consumption, an increase of at least half a serving per day was associated with a 13\% higher mortality risk (1.13, 1.04 to 1.23) and a 9\% higher mortality risk (1.09, 1.02 to 1.17), respectively. A decrease in consumption of processed or unprocessed red meat of at least half a serving per day was not associated with mortality risk. The association between increased red meat consumption and mortality risk was consistent across subgroups defined by age, physical activity, dietary quality, smoking status, or alcohol consumption. Conclusion Increases in red meat consumption, especially processed meat, were associated with higher overall mortality rates.}

  abstract = {Abstract             The CRISPR-Cas system is a highly adaptive and RNA-guided immune system found in bacteria and archaea, which has applications as a genome editing tool and is a valuable system for studying the co-evolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage interactions. Here introduces CRISPRimmunity, a new web server designed for Acr prediction, identification of novel class 2 CRISPR-Cas loci, and dissection of key CRISPR-associated molecular events. CRISPRimmunity is built on a suite of CRISPR-oriented databases providing a comprehensive co-evolutionary perspective of the CRISPR-Cas and anti-CRISPR~systems. The platform achieved a high prediction accuracy of 0.997 for Acr prediction when tested on a dataset of 99 experimentally validated Acrs and 676 non-Acrs, outperforming other existing prediction tools. Some of the newly identified class 2 CRISPR-Cas loci using CRISPRimmunity have been experimentally validated for cleavage activity in vitro. CRISPRimmunity offers the catalogues of pre-identified CRISPR systems to browse and query, the collected resources or databases to download, a well-designed graphical interface, a detailed tutorial, multi-faceted information, and exportable results in machine-readable formats, making it easy to use and facilitating future experimental design and further data mining. The platform is available at http://www.microbiome-bigdata.com/CRISPRimmunity. Moreover, the source code for batch analysis are published on Github (https://github.com/HIT-ImmunologyLab/CRISPRimmunity).},

  abstract = {Synthetic biology enables the design of gene networks to confer specific biological functions, yet it remains a challenge to rationally engineer a biological trait as complex as longevity. A naturally occurring toggle switch underlies fate decisions toward either nucleolar or mitochondrial decline during the aging of yeast cells. We rewired this endogenous toggle to engineer an autonomous genetic clock that generates sustained oscillations between the nucleolar and mitochondrial aging processes in individual cells. These oscillations increased cellular life span through the delay of the commitment to aging that resulted from either the loss of chromatin silencing or the depletion of heme. Our results establish a connection between gene network architecture and cellular longevity that could lead to rationally designed gene circuits that slow aging.           ,              Editor's summary                            Yeast cells have a transcriptional toggle switch that leads them to die by one of two fates: One causes death by nucleolar decline, the other by mitochondrial decay. By rewiring this transcriptional switch into a negative-feedback loop, Zhou               et al               . were able to cause yeast cells to oscillate between the two states and increase their life span by 82\% (see the Perspective by Salis). These results represent a step forward toward the use of engineering principles to design synthetic gene circuits that control complex biological traits. ---L. Bryan Ray                        ,              Preventing yeast cells from normal deterioration of aging through synthetic biology markedly extends life span.},

  abstract = {We consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference. A principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. We present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. Our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data.}
