  "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells rely on rapid molecule exchange at specialized organelle-organelle contact sites. ER-mitochondrial contact sites (ERMCSs) are vital communication hubs. This study uses high-speed molecular tracking integrated with 3D electron microscopy to map diffusion distribution and ultrastructure of ERMCSs, revealing contact site interface structures and diffusion landscapes.",
