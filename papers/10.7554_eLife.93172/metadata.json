  "abstract": "The female reproductive system is the first to age. This study identifies exceptionally long-lived proteins in mammalian ovaries and oocytes using multi-generational metabolic stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry. Ovaries exhibit localized structural and cell-type specific enrichment of stable macromolecules. Both ovaries and oocytes harbor a panel of exceptionally long-lived proteins, including cytoskeletal, mitochondrial, and oocyte-derived proteins.",
