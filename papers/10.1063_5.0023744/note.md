## Abstract

Characterization of the elasticity of biological cells is growing as a new way to gain insight into cell biology. Cell mechanics are related to most aspects of cellular behavior, and applications in research and medicine are broad. Current methods are often limited since they require physical contact or lack resolution. From the methods available for the characterization of elasticity, those relying on high frequency ultrasound (phonons) are the most promising because they offer label-free, high (even super-optical) resolution and compatibility with conventional optical microscopes. In this Perspective contribution, we review the state of the art of picosecond ultrasonics for cell imaging and characterization, particularly for Brillouin scattering-based methods, offering an opinion for the challenges faced by the technology. The challenges are separated into biocompatibility, acquisition speed, resolution, and data interpretation and are discussed in detail along with new results.
