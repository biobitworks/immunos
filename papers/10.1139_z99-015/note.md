## Abstract

This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal). This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief. Western Blots from Figs. 8B and 9A appear similar to Blots from Fig. 4A of the article previously published by the authors in Biochemistry and Cell Biology 93 (2015) 210-226 https://doi.org/10.1139/bcb-2014-0114 and Figs. 12 and 14 of the article previously published by the corresponding author et al. in Biomedicine & Preventive Nutrition 4 (2014) 561-577 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bionut.2014.08.003, although the Western Blots purportedly described different samples. Also, sections within the panels from Figs. 10 and 11D appear unusually similar to each other. The explanation provided by the corresponding author was not satisfactory and the Editor decided to retract the article.
