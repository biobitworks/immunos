# Daily Log: 2025-12-21

## Summary

Started restructuring IMMUNOS to be a standalone multi-agent AIS system
(MCP optional for packaging). Added core documentation and handoff workflow.

## Decisions

- Package name remains `immunos_mcp`.
- Dashboard stays in `/Users/byron/projects/scripts`.
- General templates remain in `/Users/byron/projects/templates`.
- IMMUNOS-specific templates stay under `immunos-mcp/`.

## Progress

- Added documentation:
  - `immunos-mcp/docs/overview.md`
  - `immunos-mcp/docs/architecture.md`
  - `immunos-mcp/docs/roadmap.md`
  - `immunos-mcp/docs/handoff.md`
  - `immunos-mcp/docs/deployment-airgap.md`
- Added algorithms doc:
  - `immunos-mcp/docs/algorithms.md`
- Added USB build guidance:
  - `immunos-mcp/docs/usb-build.md`
- Reorganized package layout:
  - Moved core/agents/algorithms/servers under `src/immunos_mcp/`
  - Updated imports from `src.*` to `immunos_mcp.*`
- Added orchestrator skeleton:
  - `src/immunos_mcp/orchestrator/orchestrator.py`
- Added dendritic and memory agents:
  - `src/immunos_mcp/agents/dendritic_agent.py`
  - `src/immunos_mcp/agents/memory_agent.py`
- Updated README usage examples to use the orchestrator API.
- Wired MCP wrapper to call the orchestrator.
- Added orchestrator signals and agent metadata.
- Calibrated confidence using dendritic signals.
- Updated MCP README to reflect orchestrator usage.
- Added MCP output details (agents + signals).
- Added file-backed memory store.
- Added orchestrator smoke test.
- Added memory clear CLI option in orchestrator.
- Documented memory persistence path in architecture docs.
- Added memory agent unit test.
- Documented orchestrator CLI options in README.
- Added `docs/cli.md` and updated `README_MCP.md` with CLI usage.
- Installed pytest and added `tests/conftest.py` for imports.
- Tests passed: `tests/test_orchestrator.py`, `tests/test_memory_agent.py`.
- Added `docs/testing.md` and updated README test command.
- Updated project docs to reflect `src/immunos_mcp` layout.
- Ran local doc review via `scripts/immunos_review.py --quick` (Ollama unreachable).
- Cleaned duplicate entry in `docs/handoff.md`.
- Added stub embedder at `src/immunos_mcp/embeddings/cached_embedder.py`.
- Noted embedding cache as planned in offline deployment docs.
- Updated QML-AiNet plan links to relative paths.
- Verified Ollama running (local models listed).
- Completed LLM doc review of `immunos-mcp/docs` via `immunos_review.py --quick`.
- Confirmed dashboard running at `http://localhost:5001/monitor`.
- Added model role mapping docs and YAML config.
- Added prompt pack for Claude/Opus and agent roles.
- Added automatic model role loading in orchestrator.
- Updated prompts to include explicit file locations for easy reuse.
- Added role-specific prompts for routing, NegSl-AIS, QML-AiNet, Opt-AiNet, air-gap, and doc audits.
- Added IMMUNOS journal template:
  - `immunos-mcp/docs/templates/immunos-journal.md`

## Open Questions

- Default USB size set to 256GB (512GB recommended for larger model sets).

## Next Steps

1. Create `docs/vm-build.md` only if VM path is chosen.
2. Expand orchestrator beyond B/NK to include dendritic + memory.
3. Align packaging with `immunos_mcp` imports.
