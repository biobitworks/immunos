# 2025-12-23

- Moved the immunOS replication preprint to `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/` and updated links in `README.md`, `INDEX.md`, `docs/handoff.md`, and `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
- Added Obsidian-friendly scaffolding in `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/README.md` and `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/LINKS.md`, and linked it in `/Users/byron/projects/HOME.md`.
- Updated `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/immunos-preprint-v1.md` (trimmed related work, synthesis paragraph, methods/metrics table, SciFact pipeline figure placeholder).
- Expanded PubMed-backed citations in `/Users/byron/projects/docs/reference/publications-log.md`.
- Added NegSl-AIS replication notes at `/Users/byron/projects/docs/reference/negsl-ais-2025-baseline.md`.
- SciFact baseline replication (oracle dev) completed; metrics logged in `/Users/byron/projects/docs/reference/scifact-baseline-replication.md` from `/Users/byron/projects/data/immunos_data/research/scifact/logs/metrics_dev.json`.
- SciFact open-retrieval pipeline moved to step-by-step runs:
  - TF-IDF retrieval output: `/Users/byron/projects/data/immunos_data/research/scifact/prediction/abstract_retrieval_open.jsonl`
  - Logs: `/Users/byron/projects/data/immunos_data/research/scifact/logs/open_retrieval.log`, `/Users/byron/projects/data/immunos_data/research/scifact/logs/open_rationale.log`
- Expanded the preprint with experimental setup details, a reproducibility checklist, an open dev placeholder, expanded references, and a Zenodo metadata stub in `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/immunos-preprint-v1.md`.
- Set PMCID fields to `TBD` in `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/immunos-preprint-v1.md` pending verification.
- Appended full JSON outputs, timings, and model roles for smoke tests to `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-mcp/logs/orchestrator_runs.log`.
- Added one-line summary entries to `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-mcp/logs/orchestrator_runs.log` for easy reporting.
- Ran terminal-only orchestrator smoke tests (research domain):
  - “SIRT1 activates autophagy”: support, 66.4% confidence, anomaly True, agents `research_bcell` + `research_nk`.
  - “SIRT1 does not activate autophagy”: support, 64.9% confidence, anomaly True, agents `research_bcell` + `research_nk`.
- Created persistent log for orchestrator prompts/responses: `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-mcp/logs/orchestrator_runs.log`.
- SciFact open dev pipeline completed; metrics logged in `/Users/byron/projects/data/immunos_data/research/scifact/logs/metrics_dev_open.json` and reflected in `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/immunos-preprint-v1.md` and `/Users/byron/projects/docs/reference/scifact-baseline-replication.md`.
- Added MAHNOB-HCI access checklist and request template at `/Users/byron/projects/research/datasets/mahnob-hci.md` and linked it in `/Users/byron/projects/research/datasets/README.md`; updated IMMUNOS dataset status.
- Verified MAHNOB portal root loads but `https://mahnob-db.eu/hci-tagging/` currently returns 404; noted in `/Users/byron/projects/research/datasets/mahnob-hci.md`.
- Added MAHNOB-HCI-Tagging manual PDF link to `/Users/byron/projects/research/datasets/mahnob-hci.md`.
- Added the IEEE T-AFFC MAHNOB-HCI paper citation (DOI: 10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.25) and a replication summary to `/Users/byron/projects/research/datasets/mahnob-hci.md`.
- Added TorchEEG MAHNOBDataset reference + loader notes to `/Users/byron/projects/research/datasets/mahnob-hci.md`.
- Added iBUG MAHNOB-Implicit-Tagging page reference + source note to `/Users/byron/projects/research/datasets/mahnob-hci.md`.
- Citation verification: added 3 missing PubMed links to 2025-12-22 entries in `/Users/byron/projects/docs/reference/publications-log.md`; 21 entries verified, 0 duplicates.
- Added Citation Relevance table (15 rows: 3 core, 8 supporting, 4 adjacent) to `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/immunos-preprint-v1.md`.
- Additional orchestrator tests logged: "Resveratrol extends lifespan", "mTOR inhibition promotes autophagy", "Metformin increases NAD+" — all classified support with 65-67% confidence.
