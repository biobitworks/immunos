# 2025-12-23

- Drafted v1 preprint for immunOS replication and moved it to `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/immunos-preprint-v1.md`.
- Added project scaffolding with Obsidian-friendly links in `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/README.md` and `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/LINKS.md`.
- Logged SciFact baseline dev metrics in `/Users/byron/projects/docs/reference/scifact-baseline-replication.md` from `/Users/byron/projects/data/immunos_data/research/scifact/logs/metrics_dev.json`.
- Created `/Users/byron/projects/docs/reference/negsl-ais-2025-baseline.md` with NegSl-AIS replication notes and dataset status.
- Added a non-BibTeX publications log entry for NegSl-AIS and queued PubMed searches in `/Users/byron/projects/docs/reference/publications-log.md`.
- Pulled PubMed abstracts/metadata for the requested searches and updated `/Users/byron/projects/docs/reference/publications-log.md`.
- Expanded and pruned related work citations in `/Users/byron/projects/immunos-replication-preprint/immunos-preprint-v1.md` with a synthesis paragraph.
- Hardened privacy/persistence workflow by sanitizing shared context files, adding local-only private notes, and tightening `.gitignore` to keep private artifacts out of version control.
- Rewrote root repo history to remove private artifacts and force-pushed the cleaned history.
- Converted embedded repos into submodules, standardized `.gitmodules`, and pushed updated submodule refs and related repo commits.
- Ignored Obsidian workspace state and removed local scifact scratch artifacts to keep the repo clean.
