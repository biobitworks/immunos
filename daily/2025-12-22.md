# 2025-12-22

- Moved shared dataset root to `/Users/byron/projects/data/immunos_data` and updated docs.
- Added `docs/training.md` and linked it from `README.md`.
- Added `IMMUNOS_DATA_ROOT` support and `--db-path` for NegSel persistence; `save_to_db` now creates tables.
- Training runs:
  - Code security scanner: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/code_security_scanner/scanner.py`
  - NegSel: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 src/immunos_mcp/algorithms/negsel.py train /Users/byron/projects/immunos-mcp/src --num-detectors 20 --r-self 0.85 --db-path .immunos/db/immunos.db`
- Added hallucination and network training CLIs under `src/immunos_mcp/training/`.
- Added save/load support for BCell, NK, and Enhanced NK, plus orchestrator flags `--bcell-state` and `--nk-state`.
- Training runs saved:
  - Hallucination: `.immunos/agents/hallucination_bcell.json`, `.immunos/agents/hallucination_nk.json`
  - Network: `.immunos/agents/network_nk_enhanced.json`
- Added `SimpleTextEmbedder` and used it for hallucination training; NK detectors now generate with `--nk-threshold 0.85`.
- Added domain routing via `src/immunos_mcp/config/agent_routes.json` and orchestrator `--domain` support.
- Added SciFact research trainer (`src/immunos_mcp/training/research_trainer.py`) and docs.
- Downloaded SciFact dataset into `/Users/byron/projects/data/immunos_data/research/scifact/data` and fixed nested `data/data` extraction.
- Trained research agents with SciFact and saved `.immunos/agents/research_bcell.json` + `.immunos/agents/research_nk.json`.
- Updated IMMUNOS dashboard monitor with an Orchestrator Map tab, live agent network canvas, and refreshed domain descriptions.
- Added orchestrator map tab updates: simulate detection button, domain stats loading, and live agent graph in the monitor dashboard.
- Added API endpoints for domain stats and event ingestion/simulation; orchestrator can emit events via `/api/events/detection`.
- Restarted dashboard server on port 5001.
- Added domain stats API, simulation endpoint, and map resize on tab switch for the dashboard.
- Restarted dashboard server on port 5001 after applying changes.
- Generated markdown snapshots for all code files under `/Users/byron/projects` at `/Users/byron/projects/docs/code-snapshots` using `scripts/export_code_snapshots.py`.
- Prepared commits for immunos-mcp and projects repo with dashboard updates and code snapshot exports.
- Added Spleen Summary panel + `/api/spleen/summary` for global anomaly triage.
- Added Agent Foundry (Bone Marrow) UI + `/api/agents/templates` + `/api/agents/foundry` endpoints.
- Added KB pages for immune-system feature map, IMMUNOS MVP, and references.
- Added presentation drafts under `docs/presentations/`.
- Added KB access in the monitor (list + markdown viewer).
- Updated dashboard review + phased plan to reflect new features.
- Restarted dashboard server on port 5001 after UI/API updates.
- Removed `immunos-mcp` from the tracked repo and kept IMMUNOS as the primary project name (package name remains `immunos_mcp`).
- Fixed Spleen Summary 500s by ensuring API DB connections are initialized and missing tables return empty counts.
