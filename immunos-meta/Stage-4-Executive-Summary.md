# Stage 4 - Executive Summary (Draft)

## What Exists Today
- Multi-project workspace with immunos-mcp, immunos81, and preprint materials.
- SciFact baseline replication logs and metrics (oracle + open).
- Journals and references organized via Obsidian-based vault.
- README coverage added across top-level and major subfolders.
- Papers now indexed via `papers/INDEX.md`, `papers/index.csv`, and `papers/index.json`.

## Immediate Risks / Gaps
- Preprint location canonicalized to `immunos-preprint/`; ensure external links updated.
- No single public release bundle for replication (scripts + env + datasets).
- Product packaging scope for immunos-mcp not formalized (core vs add-ons).
- Licensing decision not finalized for ROI.
- DOI folders are hard to browse without title/year aliases.

## Next Steps (High Priority)
1) Confirm canonical preprint location and submission target.
2) Freeze replication artifacts and generate a public bundle.
3) Decide licensing strategy and publish contributor guidelines.
4) Define VM/USB builder MVP (scope + timeline + components).
5) Choose DOI navigation plan (by-year index files vs alias notes).
